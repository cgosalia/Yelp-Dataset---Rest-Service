    <review:review_text>A favorite for dinner.  Scores with the trifecta of great food, good service, and killer ambiance.  Dark and romantic.  Really good moody alternative music playing in the background.  Comfy booths that make you want to linger over dinner for hours.  I guess the story is that it is supposed to resemble the smokehouses of the Netherlands?  I can't comment about that because I have never been to the Netherlands, but I love the vibe here.   Upscale.  American/New American food.  Meat intensive, so don't bring your vegetarian date here.  Don't over-order, the portions are quite big.  That's it.  Go.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>quite possible the only starbucks in arizona that could be referred to as the gay starbucks and people would know what your talking about, (kinda like gay denny's), i wouldn't even relate that fame to the constant cast of characters outside "people watching" but for awhile, 90% of the employees were gay.

this starbucks is a great place to sit outside and chill and chat up the regulars. i miss alot of the former employees of this starbucks, they were all really cool people. some of them just randomly disappeared, whatever happened to that skinny guy who kinda looked like the devil, and that Blondie? what would you need to do to get fired?? being too cool for everyone? oh well. 

i have been comped so many drinks here its no wonder the last two managers were fired. lol. but that's part of the things that made me love this bux. cool employees who knew how to make you come back. (maybe I'll get a free drink today....no? well maybe next time)

chain coffee shops are considered the antichrist to a lot of coffee shop superheros but lets face it. the coffee isn't so great..neither is the food, but it's the status symbol to have that green straw in your cup.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Breakfast is a fine time to eat here. Don't eat here any other time. The supposed brick oven pizza is soggy and nasty with unripe tomato. The other menu items must come from a bag as if you ask for the fish, say, not blackened, this is not possible. The pasta was decent and even al dente but the service surly and got drinks wrong. Really you mess up Pepsi? The guy for breakfast was so nice we came back an we only have regret. Only good for morning.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>overall good customer service. had the server katie. took care of us very well. the mini donut things with a side of chocolate were extremely tasteful. one thing i shall say. throughout the glamour and the service. there hookahs weren't the best. i smoke a lot, and i have not had a bowl burn so quick. we had three hookahs. all brought out at once. and all three burnt out the same. the staff was very good on fixing that problem. again real good service. 
good spot. just work on the hookah preparation.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Can't describe how bad this place is...was hoping for some good Mexican to replace Baja Fresh location and all we got were cheap ingredients in bland tasting Mexican slop. The guac is from frozen, cheese is cheapest shredded stuff you can get, oily food, hardly any spices. Taco Bell is better than this place and much cheaper...won't be returning.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Best hookah lounge in Vegas the owner put so much time and detail into building this place from scratch and you can see it from one glance. The atmosphere is so comforting and homelike. The food is just amazing, there isn't one thing on the menu I haven't liked yet. The service is fast and efficient, the staff is friendly and makes sure you are satastifed before leaving. They have a full tobacco selection and the hookahs last over 45 mins!! Music is great (omg the DJ booth, I felt like I was at the club), it's a place you can go chill with friends or party, depending on the mood your in. This lounge offers the best of both worlds. Finally a place in Vegas with a mature crowd, good hookah amazing food and a friendly staff must check out place!! So proud of Sarkis for opening this great spot that locals and out of town people can enjoy. Hookah Master's lounge is the new hot spot for sure!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The polio vaccine. 
Plymouth Rock.
The earth is round.

A list of great human discoveries would not be complete without, perhaps, the most important of all.

NEVER use the regular cashiers at Walgreen's. Go directly to the cosmetics counter. Cue the heavenly muzak. Yes, yelpers, I NEVER wait for my Snore Strips, Snicker bars or Burt's Bee's Lip Balm. I grab and buy. Otherwise you're behind the lady with the coupons. And she's still cuttin them out. Or the five pimple faced teenagers. All paying separately. Or, the worst, someone who apparently is stocking their bomb shelter and has two carts full of crap.

NEVER. Just go to the cosmetics counter. Tell 'em Thomas S. sent ya!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>5 stars for food and service. The atmosphere and decor could use some help -- the interior is clean and neat, but dated. The outside/exterior can't be helping business -- if you can get past the stark white exterior walls, the green roof line, and the nondescript sign, you'll be treated to a good, "from scratch" meal that tastes homemade, with excellent/friendly service. This is a great place for breakfast.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I love the Sunroom Cafe. I'm there nearly everytime I'm in Madison. Sitting above State Street with the sun steaming in, eating a reasonably priced breakfast just feels good. I disagree that it seems "granola," but it's casual and laid back for sure.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>3.5 if half stars were available. The food was okay and the service above average. I went to Tom's as a tourist and I think this might have more appeal to locals. It seems to be a Cheers place where everybody knows your name and pictures of local politicians are on the walls. A nice joint for beers and burgers.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I found the staff really friendly, and the clientele too! It's a pretty long menu with reasonable prices. Great salsa; can't tell if they make their own chips though.. back in Queens you could tell by how greasy the chips where.

The decor is just this side of Salvation Army, which just adds to the charm for me. St. Patrick's Day was coming up and they had green decorations hanging from the ceiling, which was also amusing given the sombreros on the walls and the overall redness of the furnishings.

Try the albondingas soup. It's a spicy beef broth with two meatballs.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Oh Uncle T's ...how do I love thee?

I don't get to Uncle T's too much anymore because I don't live as close as I used to - but whenever I took breaks from the library up the street while I was working on my dissertation, Uncle T's provided sustenance.  I would get the chicken and spicy avocado sandwich, toasted.  Always get it toasted.  Don't get it on the baguette either because it will be too hard to eat and all of the fillings will fall out - trust me, I know.  

When you eat in, they give you loads of napkins and usually a fork as well so you can gobble up all of the goodness which will inevitably fall out of your overfilled sandwich of toasty tastiness.  

It's even gotten to the point where the owner, his son, and the random guy who is always hanging out with the owner when he's not busy, all know who I am.  Whenever I go in these days they say they thought I'd moved back to America and they're so glad I'm still around.

The only down side of Uncle T's:
It's really hard to actually eat IN here but there aren't many places to actually take your sandwich as, let's face it, it's Scotland and there aren't many days in the year when it's nice enough to sit outside.  But, the tables here are tiny and extremely low, which makes eating in a bit tricky.
The other down side is the owner's buddy who always wants to chat about politics - and once he found out I'm American, had a field day with me.  Actually, since Obama he's been much better but before the election  it was getting pretty old.... 

But to sum up - Uncle T's - top notch sandwiches all the way</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Not bad at all but is not even close to great Chinese food we've had elsewhere in the country. We still have not found a great place in the valley so our search continues.

It would have been better, however, the Mongolian Beef we had tasted like burnt oil and overpowered any other flavor it might have had. The other two dishes were acceptable and we would eat them again.

Again, food was ok and definitely not a place to be avoided.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>By far, the best Gentleman's Club in Phoenix.  The girls here are gorgeous.  It is a little pricier than some of the other places, but the eye candy is the best.  

Have fun other weary travelers!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Since this is a new location, i wanted to see if the roasted milk tea with grass jelly (half sugar no ice) was just as good as their other locations - and it was.

Please be sure to try this at least once!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The Canon's Gait is one of a number of pubs which takes up its position at the lower end of Canongate. With a spacious sitting area on the street level and a function room below, this pub offers meals, the occasional gig (music and comedy), and drinks which are slightly on the more expensive side of the coin! 

However, this pub is perfectly situated for tourists who just happen to be hungry and thirsty before their excursion to the parliament. The food on offer is of a good quality, I didn't begrudge paying the little extra for my large portion of fish and chips! The pub also provides a good selection of local ales which is always a bonus! 

This place is good for a wee drink and a bite to eat, and is a prime spot for tourists, but to me, this pub doesn't stand out from the rest.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Went here for an Italian Beef.... Being a big fan of Chicago junk food, I thought I would give it a go. Friendly staff claimed that they modeled the place after Portillos in Chicago. Good place to try and emulate. That said, the beef sandwich was very good size, the hot peppers and sweet peppers were very tasty and the flavor was great. y only complain was that the beef was a bit tough.... If you ever ate a Portillos Italian beef, you would know that the beef should just fall apart and be very juicy... Seemed to me that maybe the beef didn't quite cool long enough.... Bottom line is, the place is pretty new and I think will get better and better. I would definitely go back. Give it a try</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Honestly, I can't see what the fuss is all about with Monty's.  It's certainly a staple of the Madison community, and the food is decent, but I find it overpriced, and the waits too long for the quality of the food.  Classic diner feel gives it a slight bump, but really, I think it's an average place, with average food.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place is huge, and that is good because it can get packed pretty quickly on the weekends. This is especially true when the weather outside forces us to look for indoor activities. 

Unlike the previous poster, I initially had a hard time figuring out the computer seated at the table. I kept jamming my fat little fingers onto the screen expecting a touch screen response. Fortunately the other bowlers in my party realized that my genius was showing and helped me figure it out. Durrrrrr. 

The bowling was fun, even though I probably should have had the bumpers on like the minors in our group did. At least then I would have not looked liked the biggest dork in three counties, just a weeny. 

We ordered deep fried cheese curds, and deep fried macaroni for snacking. No healthy eating here!!! They were yummy, and just as good as Culver's. But since I've said that, now I'll have to hide from rabid Culver's fans. Yikes! 

We'll go here again, and I can once again provide comic relief with my mad bowling skillz. 

Werd.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Without exaggeration this is the most killer brisket I have ever eaten. You can tell the people that work here truly care about their food.

    <review:review_text>Quality dance floor, vintage atmosphere, all-around cool event. Happens once a month on Saturday. Come here to learn swing dancing or just sit back and watch. The venue smells kind of funky but isn't pungent enough to significantly affect my opinion of the place. Important to note that the bar is cash only.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Not bad mexican food. I like their guacamole - even though it looks like pureed baby food. I usually get a bean and cheese deep fried burrito. The salsa is kinda too hot for me. I have eaten there at least 5 times and the food always seems to not be as hot as I would like, but still bearable.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I've been to other Old Chicago's and this one is much newer and cleaner inside, it used to be a Uno's back when I used to work over near there.  Probably why I had to add this location in Yelp.

The meatball Stromboli was pretty good, def not the best I've had but not the worst either.  Lots of sports on tv to keep us busy while waiting, which honestly wasn't that long but the manager came out to offer us free appetizer or dessert and apologized.

I'd go back :)

    <review:review_text>New in Newington

I was havering over 3 or 4 stars for this place, but I couldn't justify judging it average as it is better than that. I feel that they have clearly defined what they are about on the outside, but it gets a little bit lost on the inside, and when I say that I am referring to the mixed bag décor. However, service and product is of a very good standard, though that's normally the case when a new bar opens.

The positives? The beer range is good, real ale, craft beer as well as euro classics available. A good bottled range makes it unlikely that your beer taste won't be met. Their spirit range, however, is a little bit limited, but the basics are there. I haven't looked at their wine list, but I saw their house wine is very cheap (less than £15 a bottle) so that's great - though its almost £5 for some Sam Adams which is classed as a pretty run of the mill beer stateside.

The food is pretty damn good. We had a sharing platter with a huge portion of meaty flavoursome ribs and half a chicken which was succulent and relatively tasty. They randomly give you a chunk of corn on the cob which isn't really for sharing unless you are happy sharing saliva also?? Each table has good range of sauces, the hot sauce being nice and nippy, though their honey mustard is a bit thin and ergo pointless. Good price point for the food also.

Table service is good and the staff take the time to engage with you, and seeing as they have been mobbed every time I go in, then that's good that they know to acknowledge their guests. I haven't been downstairs but apparently it's a good size also!

My main issue here is that, similarly to other nearby new pubs, they get a bit lost with the décor and furniture, the booths have random  metal bits, and there is a huge mural which looks like they should have paid more to get it done properly. Random hanging lights and the TVs aren't quite big enough. 

They have also put a Gambling Machine in the corner, which I didn't think was an issue until I saw it, and I realised that none of the boozers I drink in actually have these. On both of my visits I noticed that the younger crowd tends not to use it, if it was my pub, I'd get rid.

Ultimately, this is a good bar, and I was pleasantly surprised, and will visit again. The big challenge here is how they will maintain the staffing levels and service, because that will make the difference. With the Southern, Cask &amp; Barrel, and  Reverie flanking it, there is plenty of passing custom to keep it lively.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>As a child (along with Burger King), Kentucky Fried Chicken (as it was called then), was my favorite fast food restaurant. You couldn't go wrong with the "Original Recipe" (only option back then... it was just called chicken because there was no "Extra Crispy") and mashed potatoes.  Sure the coleslaw made me vomit through my nose (just wasn't ready for it then), but Kentucky Fried Chicken was the best.

Years later, "Extra Crispy" became available and I realized how hard the "Original Recipe's" texture sucked!

Novelty drove me to KFC yesterday.  I went with the white meat combo ... "Extra Crispy".  I started with the chicken.  The batter was really caked on.  I forgot haw thick the layers of batter get with KFC.  My initial bite started off satisfying, the flavors helped me relive those great fast foodie moments of my childhood.  From there, the mirage took off.

The batter is caked on so thickly that there is a space between the chicken and the crispy exterior that's moist mush.  It was so disgusting, I could only eat select portions of the batter I knew were crisp.  

The chicken was so far from free-range, it tasted as if were raised in a can.  The breast was moist, but it oddly had the flavor and some of the texture of thigh meat (I can't stand dark meat chicken). 

I went with the wedges.  They are flavored like curly fries, but with twice the seasoning.  The first part of the bite was solid, but the guts of the wedges were a mushy potato with the consistency of mashed potatoes -- yeah, deep-fried mashed potatoes --- %&amp;u% GROSS!

The only thing I finished here was the soda.  I hope in 10 years, when I consider coming back, I read this review and realize some things are best left in childhood.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Whenever the train I'm meant to be getting in the evening is delayed I usually end up in here - it's very handy for the station and never very busy, those are probably it's only two discerning features though. The bar is the kind of faux traditional that a large percentage of Edinburgh's pubs are, it's cosy enough but not particularly welcoming or friendly. The aussie barman generally looks like he can't be arsed and would rather be somewhere else (Sydney perhaps, with a schooner of Toohy's New), to be fair I don't blame him as this place seems to attract more than its fair share of confused tourists. Mostly though I am irritated by the price of the ginger beer: it costs near enough the same as a pint of ale, which in this day and age of responsible drinking is wrong wrong wrong.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The food is good, but my favorite thing about the place is the art.  I know I'm weird, but they really do have some great pieces to peruse as you nibble those chips and salsa.  

While this isn't my #1 Mexican spot, it's location has a been a great center meeting point with friends.  The food is never disappointing and service has always been good.  Very good actually.  Oh the stories I could tell about our friend doing some super heavy flirting with one of the waiters.  Though at that level it's hardly even flirting anymore.  More like a direct offer.  But anyhow... He handled it smoothly as silk.  This would lead me to guess they have a pretty good bar, which my friend was enjoying of course.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>So they are brand new and clearly unsure of what they are doing. No big deal they were friendly and trying to do the best they could. I ordered the buffalo chicken pita and had it customized because I didn't care of some of the suggested ingredients. The buffalo sauce has a hint of BBQ sauce taste and I hate the taste of BBQ. I ate about a quarter of it and had to be done. I got the berry berry smoothie which was delicious so I at least have that. I will try again just maybe something different next time.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This past weekend I was visiting Madison for a conference and ate at the Nitty Gritty with a group of 50 people. The service was outstanding, friendly, attentive and quick. My water glass was never empty. The restaurant has two levels with high ceilings and polished wood floors. A relaxed, clean atmosphere.

My table of 5 started with chicken strips, good and standard and spinach dip. The spinach dip is excellent, extra cheesy and hot served with chips, and fresh veggies- carrots, celery, broccoli and cauliflower.

We all had burgers and fries. The burger was enormous I could only eat 1/2. Pretty good deal for around $6.

If you are in the area I recommend  the Nitty Gritty.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>**Summary**
       - Quality - Nothing was cooked, everything tasted nice, and the service was excellent.
       - Value - If you go in Mon - Sat at 3:30pm, you're essentially paying lunch price for a dinner buffet.
**Price**
       - $4.99 Breakfast 8am-11am Mon - Sat
       - $6.99 Lunch 11am-4pm Mon - Sat
       - $9.99 Dinner 4pm-9pm Sun - Thurs, 4pm-10pm Fri &amp; Sat
       - $9.99 Brunch 8am-4pm Sun
**Available**
       - BBQ Beef Ribs - Friday and Saturday nights, they have BBQ Beef Ribs on the BBQ carving station. Decently meaty and pretty great for the price. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/djAWtGq2IxKaxMIMw-P58A?select=PF1DKVOMCtrbFMAS-E-_GQ)
       - Sea Bass - Their sea bass is moist and flaky.
       - Roast Beef - They didn't have prime rib, but it was tender on the inside.
       - Ham - Giant ham that wasn't too salty and was cooked right.
       - Everything else is just normal things you find at a buffet.
**Recommendations**
       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a cheap buffet. Save the ribs, nothing particularly stands out. However, given the price, you're getting a lot of bang for your buck.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Had the steak bowl with udon noodles and the crab cheese wonton roll. Steak was very tender and juicy. The wonton rolls were fantastic. The atmosphere in the restaurant is very laid back, everyone was super freiendly. 

Will definitely be coming back to try something different.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Here's a place with a lot of potential, the bar area is dark and old boys club in feel, with a large oval bar.  The drinks were "healthy" and reasonably priced.  Its definately an older supperclubby feel, but in a warm, comfortable, cardigan sweater on a cold winter day sort of way.  The big downfall here was the food.  I had heard good things and maybe I just was there on an off day, but my meal was a filet with breaded shrimp and stuffed potato and none of it lived up to expectations.  The steak was so raw I could only eat the edges, the breaded shrimp were more bread than shrimp and the potato reminded me of a christmas bunt cake and not in a good way.  Ill give them another chance because we were with a big group and even the best restaurants have off days, but at our table we all had similar thoughts on the food.    And to be fair I didnt ask for any adjustments, the management seemed very accomodating to guests in the bar and dining areas.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I went here for a 50p Comedy show once. The show was held in the basement which was a little dark and dingy. As you can imagine a 50p comedy show wasn't exactly fantastic. 

The upper bar area is a lot nicer and quite spacious. The bar was a little empty which didn't compliment the large space. It was a Monday night though, so it might pick up on other nights. I probably wouldn't go out my way to come here as the staff weren't particularly great and the drinks weren't cheap, but if you are in the area then ideal for a quick drink.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Okay so here goes my review as you know I'm trying to find the best Italian food in Las Vegas been several Italian restaurants and montesano's is still the best I've had in Las Vegas the pizza here which was a pepperoni lovers was a good pizza but if you're going to have a pepperoni lovers Pizza put a lot more pepperoni on it the spaghetti meatballs the meatballs were very good good flavor however the marinara sauce was a little too sweet in my opinion the garlic bread was very dry and not very garlicky the house salad had a good flavor to it very simple salad but good all in all not the best Italian food I've ever had but good ambience and very very good service.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>am i the only one who thinks pottery barn has gone down hill? pottery barn has never been my style to begin with, every now and then i find things i like but there's something country about it and i don't like country. 

anyway. 

the quality is not what it used to be. and the service is farrrr from good. 

just today i was accused of being dishonest because i wanted to return some crappy plates that were falling apart. 

"are you sure it's not just normal wear and tear? we have a lot of people trying to return stuff so they can have brand new dishes before the holidays."

"um, that most certainly is not me and im offended you would insinuate i'm trying to do that"

"im not insinuating anything ma'am." 

"really? then why say it?"

i expect this sorta crap from target but im totally shocked pottery barn is hopping on the crappy customer service wagon. 

let me get this straight:
you sell me borderline expensive crap, i complain about the crap and want to return it, instead of standing behind your product and taking care of your customer, you suggest that a lot of people are dishonest when they return stuff but i shouldn't take offense? 

the problem is not me, its you and your crappy dishes.

 i won't be returning.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Pottery Barn is a nice serene store. Kind helpful employees, but not intrusive. I enjoy walking through when at the Biltmore, Alas for me the merchandise is geared toward folks who have yet to develop a personal style. Very generic in design for the most part. So this might be why it is so serene, it does not excite my senses. They have nice usable products.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Nice light food which is a good break from everything else Vegas has to offer. Buffalo chicken is really good, ham and cheese is decent, bacon and egg is good but too cheesy.

I stopped by a few times because its fast, not chain food and pretty tasty/cheap.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I love Baby Kay's like pirates love stealing. It's good enough to wipe clean the memory of taking a horrible girlfriend there for our first date. The craw fish ettouffe is something I have to stop to contemplate each bite of because I struggle to comprehend why it's so delicious. The gumbo and jambalaya are also stellar. I like to merge all three in the Cajun Combination. 

They make a raspberry vinaigrette there that deserves it's own paragraph and is mandatory on your dinner salad. 

Another fantastic creation here is the apricot habenero glaze that one would think would over-power a chicken salad, not the case. Now I know most of you see the h-word and imagine terrible pain, this dish is not prohibitively hot, it manages to catch the flavor of the much maligned pepper and only a fraction of its fire. 

 If you happen upon Baby Kay's  on a day when the special is seafood enchiladas, get them and call me for a refund if you anything less than amazed. 

 Staff is pretty low key and nice here. Not a good call if you're in a hurry, but worth being late over. I usually sit at the bar if minutes are precious and outside if my time is my own. For what you get the prices are very reasonable.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Today is the second day I've gotten breakfast from downtow's newest fast food establishment. And I can admit, I'm a fan.I really like their biscuits. While I'm generally not a fast foodie, Carl's Jr will be a nice rotation. However, it is oddly located inside US Airways Center.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>So, we've been anxiously awaiting the opening of this place.  Signs in window prior to opening say "all organic", and we are thrilled to have a Greek restaurant in our neighborhood again! 
So, we walk in last night for dinner, and see a sign saying "Cash Only!".  Hubby ran down the street to ATM &amp; got cash.  While I was waiting for him, I see one of the employees walking thru the parking lot carrying a covered hotel tray.  Looked like he was coming from another restaurant just down the way, or maybe from an apartment.  I immediately thought "uh oh".   I then see TWO different couples walk out without food (they don't have tables, just a couple of counter seats).  I think "Oh crap".  We walk back in, and see the "Kitchen".  Uh. OK. Two electric griddles behind the counter.  A women is peeling strips of store bought gyro meat off a stack, and placing them on the griddle.  You know the ones I'm talking about if you've ever foolishly bought the frozen gyro kit in the supermarket.  
That was that.  I turn to hubby, and say "We're out of here!  If I want that crap, I'll go buy it in the damn grocery store!!" 
Totally disappointed. 
Unless you don't care about eating pre-formed &amp; sliced crap, heated up on a griddle, don't even bother walking in here.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Since I found Douglas's I've stopped going anywhere else. With Greggs, the "fresh" products actually get shipped in the night before and baked again in the morning, Douglas's take the time to make everything in store.

The food may look a little rustic, but that's because it wasn't prepared by a machine and I imagine most people wouldn't be put off once they had a bite. Sausage rolls are incredible in here and are a little cheaper (and bigger) than the rival stores.

They also seem to have an endless supply of freshly baked bread that will keep soft for a lot longer than a supermarket loaf.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I walked in, the owner was super friendly. The selection was pretty good. They are in their soft opening so they had a good amount of flavors. The owner gave me samples of anything I asked to try. I got 2 small flavors, only $7 and some change. The size small is a pretty good size for only $3.75, also they seal the bag for freshness and the bag also has a ziplock on it. It also tastes really good. I didn't find anything bad or wrong with this place. Check it out. I know I'll be back!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The newest edition to the Hookah Master's Lounge, is located a few doors down and is 18+. I love the feel of this place, it's convenient and fun! The color theme is unlike all other places and right when you walk in you feel right at home. The music is great and food is also provided from the main lounge. Of course the most important aspect being the hookah, which we all know from Hookah Master's Lounge is amazing. Overall this place is amazing to chill with friends that aren't 21 or even just to hang out at a smaller cozier place. Whatever your mood is for the night both Hookah Master's Lounge and HML provide to the full extent. Must check out spot!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I can see why there can be a wide range of opinions on this restaurant. It starts with the pizza. I know there are basically two kinds of crust, thin and thick. Old Chicago servers the latter, but I think it has a new twist. The crust to me is more like a biscuit dough. It is light and slightly crispy. Most people are used to a heavier more substantial dough. I am still getting used to the crust on the pizza here. The pizza is still good, but it makes me think. Oh well I think I have to go back for more research and beer.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place is rad. It's a themed pizza joint based on nerd, geek, and video game culture. They just opened, and they're still a work in progress with the decorations, and I think they are still even perfecting their menu, but it's already shaping up to be cool as hell here. I can picture as time goes on, this place will just get more eclectic and interesting.

The focus of the theme is old Nintendo video games from the 80s and 90s, and geek culture from comic books and cartoons to action figures and quirky toys. There's definitely a Mario Bros inspired theme here. The menu has some cool item names that are clever call-backs to video game terminology. 

It's the sort of place you might expect to find in Austin or Portland (you know - where cool people live)... or even in Tempe. I was surprised most of all to find it in West Phoenix in an older strip mall - not really near any other cool or hip things. It's almost out of place where it sits, but that's perfect since it stands out. We need more stuff like this all over the Valley. The West side some cool and unique restaurants, but they are few and far between. It's good to see stuff like this pop up.

I have a feeling that this place will keep evolving into something even more quirky and cool if the owners keep tinkering and turning all of their ideas into reality. Chatting with them, I can tell they are passionate about this stuff.

In spite of being relative newcomers to the pizza biz, they make an excellent pie. I had a Boss Battle, which is half pizza and half cheese garlic bread. It's perfect. Their dough is thick and fluffy and tastes good. Their sauce is very flavorful and different. It doesn't come out of a can, and they are still tweaking it, but it's delicious. They don't skimp on the cheese or the sauce or toppings either, and the pepperonis are spicy and tasty as well. I'm not gonna say it is the best pizza I've had in my life, but it was seriously good. I'll go out of my way (and believe me, it's out of my way) to eat here again. Plus, you get a ton of food for not much money.

It's really important to our local economy and community to have great little local gems like this pop up and thrive. If you live anywhere near here, you need to order up some delivery or stop by for some take out or hang out and eat with friends and tell the owners you're pickin up what they're puttin down and that you appreciate their existence. 

I wish we had more places like this on the East side. Metro Phoenix is so full of stuffy old conservatives that art and culture have to force their way in to our lives like blades of grass poking out through cracks in the pavement. Most people in Phoenix just play it safe with traditional names and themes when they open a restaurant (or other business). It's boring. Places like Super Pizza Bros need to be celebrated. Seriously. Insert coin.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>love DD... but this is another one that gives them a BAD NAME.

Not only was my donut was stale.... but it barely had one tiny dollop of vanilla creme inside the big donut. 

What is that? That is NOT at all how I remember them being!!

blech.....

    <review:review_text>The Canon's Gait is a big, airy bar. It's modern, but done in a traditional style, and although that sounds a little odd, it works. There are some humorous writings around the wall, and an excellent old-fashioned map of the area.


 It's a good place to chill out, especially on a hot day. The service is very good, with pleasant staff.


 I like it.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I had the 6 inch spicy Italian today. This sandwich was much better than the Subway one. My daughter had the Italian chicken panini that she said compared favorably to one she had at Postino a few days ago. A nice lunch worth a return visit.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>= = = = = =  DAILY LUNCH BUFFET!  = = = = = =

Yay, happiness is a new Buffet, especially if it's a (rare) Pakistani Buffet!  Yes, Pakistani, NOT INDIAN!  Differences, as well as some of the dishes served, include BEEF (Yay beef!!)  and no alcohol, which suits me fine at lunch time.     :-)

This Copper Kettle has opened in place of the one on Alma School Rd. and features a mid-sized dining room and a Lunch Buffet, right-sized for this type of food at about 18 main offerings plus sauces &amp; toppings.  I started with a tossed salad &amp; some delicious Lentil Soup.  Soon a basket of hot from the oven Garlic Naan arrived at my table, buttery &amp; delicious!

Back over at the hot table I helped myself to some of almost everything including Pea Palao, Basmati Rice, Beef Nahari, Beef Paya, and a number of other tasty treats including two common to both Pakistani &amp; Indian restaurants Chicken Tika Masala &amp; Tandoori Chicken (of premium chicken and cooked just right!).

I also had some Poori (a deep fried flatbread), and Sweet Halva for dessert.  There was also a custard dish &amp; more, but I didn't have room to try them this time.

The owner &amp; his assistant were super nice &amp; this Buffet is served up 7 days a week from 11 AM for under $10.     :-))</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>the boss went out with me today for a ride along to check up on my awesome sales skills. in the path of a super busy day we needed to eat and i spied this place in the parking lot so we pulled in. this is a clean little place with plenty of seating and a very clean look. you walk up and order, pay,and then pick up at the counter. they have all kinds of sandwiches, soups, and salads + a case of baked goods and sweets. i had the balsamic blue cheese salad with chicken added. the salad had apple slices, tomatoes, walnuts, cranberry's, and mixed greens. they served the dressing on the side, it was a balsamic with raspberry, they give you two little sealed containers which is more than enough (i only used one,so if you like a lot there is plenty) they also give you a piece of fresh french bread that was also tasty. i enjoyed the salad it tasted very fresh. my boss had a classic Caesar salad with chicken and also enjoyed it (kind of hard to mess that up) all in all this is a good place to grab a quick bite. i will go back if in the neighborhood and hungry.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place has the best pizza in town. I was very impressed. We ordered the deep dish pepperoni and sausage pizza. The deep dish pizza was abundant in size. We were full by our first piece. We also ordered a caprese salad - another great addition to the menu. The ingredients were fresh and delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I went to see 'Copenhagen'. The theater has an ultramodern exterior that actually hides pretty traditional, apparently the-oldest-in-Edinburgh, Victorian-style theater interior. The place was not as nicely decorated in the 1950s or 60s as is now. (I overheard the old timer relating to his friend that he used to come here with his dad back then for some cheap vaudeville shows and now it seems far more glamorous than back then). 

Well, the renovation did not include air conditioning or more leg space. Be prepared to peel off your layers. Not much can be done about long legs, I am afraid. 

The guy selling the tickets was ultra patient with me - a dumb first time tourist / visitor who does not know a zilch how the things work and needs to be explained everything twice. 

I loved the play. Definitely would recommend. A treat for the thought. And, amazingly, I warmed up to quantum physics afterwards. Even more amazingly, I think I understood what they were talking about ... Or so I think ...</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Big improvement over Ooka.  Sashimi was fresh and presentation excellent (on ice). My Wife's bento box dinner was very good, beef was a good cut very tender.  It was Valentine's day so the rose and 1 cent champagne was a surprise.  Rolls look good but prefer Sashimi to separate the flavors.  Ika (squid) salad was well done nice touch on the baby greens, tasty.  Hope my pic is posted.  Will be back,  12 yrs since arriving to Az from Calif and I finally found my family spot.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>When it comes to The Longhorn ,I got 5 on it! I love this little dumpy place. Sometimes there's a wait for a booth at the restaurant part so my husband and I, kill more time with the monster machines or more dollar coronas. I like to down 2 before I eat. Not that the food is bad I'll eat without the beer as well. It's just that it's hard to beat 1 dollar for a corona or modelo negro.Oh man! Plus the food is so cheap that you can sometimes win the money your going to spend there before you spend it! It's like eating on the house! 3.99 chicken fried steak and eggs? You bet! I get it every time. I'm craving it right now! People watching is always a great sport to partake in as well while waiting for you food or to be seated. 10 bucks total with 2 meals, 2 or 3 beers. Who can beat that!? No one baby!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I don't like this chain of pubs, no matter where I go they seem to draw in the same type of crowd, and I have been to two in London and this one in Edinburgh. The pubs attract some pretty rough characters and the food that they offer is pretty cheap but also pretty bad.

The drink prices in the pub are actually pretty decent, and during the day, Edwards would be a good place to go to for a cheap pint or two and good for a catch up with friends. It's at night when the pub really does go into decline.

On a Friday night and Saturday, an area of the pub is turned into a dance floor and I do like to get loose on many a dance floor, but this is definitely not the place I would like to come to do break out my 'moves'. The floor is really sticky and the music is exactly what you would expect with chart music that is played too loud and perving men prying on daintily clad girls who look barely old enough to get in.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Only because I had to give it a star.. So first issue was chips and salsa.. Obviously salsa was made from canned chili or it sat for a long time.. Mushy and lacking in flavor. Chips were freezing cold, and greasy.. Not the good greasy, but more saturated..

I ordered the green chili.. Horrible, it was old meat, plate was cold, sauce was split.. Hardly consumable. Ate two bites and moved on.

Carne Asada mini tacos, meh.. Meat was again old and very dry.. Like eating sand. Yikes.. Limes were old, table wobbly, service was decent, wait was too long and I won't be back.

Overall not a good experience.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I really can't see why people knock this place. Admittedly, they don't have the widest selection in the world and some of the package sizes are a bit on the large side, but overall, it's hard to beat the value. I get almost all my staple items here such as milk, lettuce, bread, ground turkey etc. Ok so if I decide it's time for musubi, I'll have to make make a run to the good ole' wal mart for the seaweed and furikake. Other than that, smart n final pretty much has everything I need and at great prices. I'm definitely a loyal customer.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Located at the bottom of Lauriston Place, this tiny supermarket (with the kind of hilariously specific name) has loads of interesting dried mushroom, loads of seaweeds, 35p for a bag of beansprouts, really cheap tofu, a million different kinds of rice and noodles...

It's also a vegetarian haven in that they have loads of cheap mock meat (for when you're feeling strange), for example fake prawns (great for tempura). Though they also have strange kind of disgusting looking canned meat. I haven't properly investigated the travel agent part, though it makes me giggle quite a bit, but the supermarket is definitely the place to go if you want to have a sushi party and feed a thousand people for under a tenner.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Wendy C., how can you review a place that you've never been to? I'm sure the Great Barrier Reef is worth a 5 star review, but I can't give it only 3 stars because its inconvenient (or any review for that matter). 

Anyway...saw Crandalls in Madison Magazine and the photos stood out to me. I didn't want to drive to the East Side for the Esquire Club. I was reluctant to try take out fish fry because I was worried about fried food getting soggy. 

I gave it a shot and I was impressed! 

First, the fish to beading ratio was really good. Big thick pieces of flaky fish with a dense, probably corn meal based, and crumb-style breaking (as opposed to the extra greasy tempura- style batter). It was nice and crunchy and the breading stayed that way on my 5-10 minute drive home. Tip: crack the styrofoam container to let the steam out for extra insurance against soggy fish. Served with a lemon. 

The fries were coated in something that made them extra crispy and they had a good seasoning. 

The slaw had good flavor but lots of dressing. Purists might say it was over dressed; others might say its just right. 

Tarter sauce was a little sweet and tangy, which was good contrast with the fish. The server gladly gave me extra. 

The bun was just as you would expect from a supper club, cheap, white, and doughy. Served with a butter chip. 

Everything was served together in a box; everything you need except several icy cold beers.

The service was fine. The take out window was nice. It takes a few minutes for the order but I think they fry-to-order which is well worth it to me and a big plus. Any you cut it, it takes less time than waiting in line for dine in Friday Fish Fry.

A little spendy for take out fish fry ringing up at over $25 for two dinners. That would be more than fair if I could park my fat ass there all night and eat all-you-can-eat. 

It's worth it though and I'll be back.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Rony is hands down the best barber in Arizona.  Prior to being referred to Rony five years ago, I bounced around to 6 or 7 barbers, and they all fell short on giving me what I really wanted.  I have referred countless friends and co-workers over the years and each one of them have been loyal customers like myself after giving him a shot.  I have friends that fly in town to visit and make stopping in to see Rony mandatory. That alone speaks volumes.

On top of it all, Rony is a great guy and makes the entire experience of getting your haircut a lot of fun.  On top of that, he's now started cutting my sons hair and he enjoys coming to see Rony each time! 

Rony also has a great staff of barbers at his new spot on 16th and Bethany Home. Give it one visit and you'll never want anyone else cutting your hair again.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Came here for brunch and shared the Crab Cakes Benedict - I'm pretty picky about crab cake and these didn't cut the mustard.  I was looking forward to the cheese grits but found them to be really tasteless.  We also shared the Malt Waffle.  You can add one of their caramel sauces to any of their waffles so we went with the caramel sauce and pecans  - this was super yummy!  However, I'd ask for the sauce on the side next time because by the time we got the waffle, the sauce had soaked through and made most of the waffle soggy.  Oh, and we had a side of bacon which I thought would only be two pieces but was pleasantly surprised to see 5 slices!  The service was really, really, really slow.  I think they may have been short staffed that day.  Overall, I would love to go back and have the Malt Waffle again and try other things on their extensive menu.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Probably just north of 3 stars, but rounded up for the excellent service.  

We got here a bit early for an 8 o clock reservation and decided to hit the bar area.  Be warned, it's not a huge bar area- only 3 tables or so and maybe 10 stools at the bar.  The wait staff there was excellent.  I ordered a pretty simple Hendrick's &amp; Tonic (any place that carries Hendrick's is alright with me), but my friend ordered a specialized drink of 1 part Hendrick's &amp; 2 part Ketel one, shaken, no garnish, with half poured and the other half chilled in a shot glass sitting in a tumbler of ice water.  SHEESH, talk about high maintenance, but they gladly made it and made it to a T.  

The steaks themselves were ok.  For the price you pay (~$40 for my bone-in ribeye), you can get a better steak just down the street at Donovan's.  Also, they don't serve any complimentary sides or anything with the steak, unless you order them.  It's just the steak on a plate of sizzling butter.  Quite gluttonous.  

I did save a little room for dessert.  I split a flourless chocolate cake with a hint of espresso and a strawberry drizzle.  It was absolutely awesome, and probably the best part of the meal, which, for a steakhouse, probably isn't a rousing endorsement.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I really wanted to like this place. The doughnuts seemed really unique.. I mean who thinks of stuffing cereal milk pudding inside of a doughnut?

I went one afternoon with my coworker, and we got a dozen of their finest (or at least what was left) which costed just over $25. Our selection included vegan, fancy and traditional doughnuts. We brought them back to work. and basically tried every flavor. 

The traditional doughnuts are nothing special. I strongly advise you to stay away from the chocolate cake doughnut, it's awful! The Vegan doughnuts are bland - not even close to Ronald's and like double the cost. The super fancy donuts are just okay. The most exciting thing about them are the descriptions. You hear the ingredient list and think that's gotta be yummy, but after you taste it you're pretty underwhelmed. I will say the bacon doughnut is pretty good. I'm usually not a fan, but they filling is divine. Would I deal with the downtown parking/traffic for it? Probably not.

I love local businesses. I hope they find a way to make their doughnuts more tasty, affordable and pretty. If I'm pay $3-$4 for a doughnut, I don't want the toppings sliding off the top.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I am a devout Pastafarian. I truly believe that noodles are a gift from the FSM 'on-high'. As such, my spiritually-necessary need for noodle never diminishes and keeps me alert to any new places that might serve His Noodly Appendage. Thanks to the sharp eyes of John Chung-En L., I was alerted to this new place on Regent.

His excellent review pretty much sums up the details. I was getting take out so I didn't get a soup but I did order a pork with fun noodle off the lunch menu and it was pretty dang tasty. A huge serving of fun noodles with moist pork and vegetables. Just about perfect. It could easy feed two for lunch. Maybe they should consider smaller portion for closer to $6 for the lunch menu?

Good stuff, check it out.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place was AWESOME! But with that being said it's basically just a giant two story Hershey's gift shop. However I am not complaining at all and I think it puts all four levels of M&amp;M's World to shame! 
They have a fun stuff for everyone and you get free samples just for walking in the door! The bakery items are delish! Although they are not made in the store, all the ones we got were sooo good! My favorite was the peanut butter cookie sandwich. 
I was also excited to see Mauna Loa Kisses, which you can only find in Hawaii and at their store. So of course those came home with us, along with the one pound PB cups and some adorable coffee mugs. 
As for the price, it wasn't too bad. I really didn't feel that it was all that outrageous considering that it is the Hershey Store on the Las Vegas strip and you are paying for the brand. 
Certainly something to check out if you are at NYNY!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is probably the closest place I have near me if I am craving some mexican food. I usually get the adobada burrito. Its really good and the staff is good too. I never had a complaint there at all. They are open most of the time too, sometimes even 24 hours. So, if you looking for something decent or craving a late night mexican meal you can't go wrong with this place.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Great place to see a show . . .

Aside from the spinning stage, which is obviously pretty rad, Celeb Theater makes my favorites list because of the acts it manages to bring to town. For being a relatively small place, they pull their weight and then some. 

I am still riding high after seeing Muse here a few months ago. I went with two friends and since the whole venue is open seating we walked in and wandered around looking for seats. This was a struggle, since my friends were 6'6" and 6'8", respectively, making me the short one at 6'3". By a miraculous stroke of luck we ran into some good friends that were saving some space in the 3rd row and they let us slide in. The people behind us weren't all that excited, but we shimmied into the aisle a bit so as to not be such an obstruction. 

Long story short: keep abreast of shows at Celebrity Theater. Good acts come around, and you will want to be there to see them first hand at a place like this.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We had a great time here. The restaurant on the second floor had the cheapest steak and eggs in town and the strawberry shortcake special was outstanding. Don't miss out on eating here, you will love it. Also the casino is good, they gave us cash back up to 100 dollars of losses on slots the same day. I don't think I have ever seen this before, it was very convenient. I didn't stay at the hotel but we had a great time here and I would recommend stopping by for a bite to eat and some risk free slot gaming.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Worst experience ever. First of all nobody was eating there so clearly they weren't busy. Nobody greeted us plus we ordered a bowl of pho and a bbq pork and sat there over 30 mins still no food. We just walked out. Literally what the fuxk??? What a waste of my time. So the bottom line is that they don't even deserve one star.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>My favorite bar in Madison.  Always a good crowd and good ratio.  Excellent beer selection and cocktail/martini varieties.  There's always some special for $5 martinis going on.  The staff is well dressed, which along with the decor makes the atmosphere a bit classier than most places in Madison, especially in the campus area. 

This is definitely a popular fraternity/sorority bar, and more recently a large foreign exchange student crowd.  Look out for their "Club BV" nights on Thursdays featuring a DJ upstairs.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Had a Chicago Dog with cheese and an Italian Beef (wet).  Both were really good.  The Italian Beef had great flavor but next time I might ask if they can add cheese to it.  Also had an order of cheese fries which were good...would be "great" if the fries were crispy.

Will stop by again when going through Fountain Hills.  Easy to get to, right on Shea Blvd.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Holyrood House we came across after walking to The Gathering and notice the palace. £10 admission, not too expensive considering the maintenance of the place for public access. Adio guide again is a must, you will learn for more that just walking around the place. Another must visit place for those into historic buildings and history of the Royals in Edinburgh &amp; Scotland. The Abbey ruins was a nice place to stop and rest for a while, we had what is know as a rare hot sunny day. If you do the castle at one end of the Mile then you will need to do Holyrood House.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>If you're looking for Mexican seafood, I'd say MPH gets the nod over other joints such as Acapulco Bay (S. Scottsdale), San Carlos Bay (CenPho), or San Diego Bay (Guadeloupe).

The place has a bit of a rep for crab enchiladas (there was a blurb in Gourmet a few years ago), but they may be one of the more bland things on the menu. 

I'm going to second the idea that the shrimp dishes are a great way to fall for this place on the first visit. The camarones culichi are awesome, with a tomatillo sauce that should be distilled into bath salts. Snapper veracruz is delicious if you're looking to test one of the more typical preparations. 

Oh -- This place isn't really that parking-sketchy (especially if you've experienced the Ranch Market demo derby up the street) and they have their own lot right in front.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>West Wing is a truly great place to enjoy a cigar.  I travel all over the U.S. and make a point to visit cigar lounges in all of the major metros.

    <review:review_text>Came here for their grand opening last week and to put it nicely, I was disappointed. I arrived at 6:30 and even though the place was busy, I managed to find a table for me and my friends by the entrance. Half an hour later and the waitress STILL hasn't noticed me, so I start texting my friends (who hadn't arrived yet), telling them about the horrible service. It's not as if she's been neglecting the other customers either; twenty minutes after I got into the place, a group of four guys sat down and got served right away. Anyway, sometime later, my friend orders a beer and that too takes a while. We decide to bounce and ask for the check. Again, a long ass wait. My friend turns to me and says, "Now I see what you were bitching about before. The service sucks here." The place gets one star for the grand opening special of $2 draft beer, but other than that, I probably won't go back...</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I expected the typical airport burrito - big price, small portion. I was glad to be wrong. While the first half was mostly potato, the second half made up for it with egg, cheese, and sausage. Only regret- not getting the salsa.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Disclaimer - I do not go to Arby's on my own, my husband loves this place and I will go here on occasion with him. 

With that being said though, I did end up signing up for their email alerts because I figured if my husband was going to eat here so often it would be good to get some deals on the food. They do send out some pretty decent coupons every once and awhile. PLUS - they sent me a FREE milkshake coupon for my birthday. I decided we had to go a few days ago so I could redeem my coupon.

First off this location is in the ghetto on Boulder Highway. Luckily, the restaurant itself is actually quite clean and well kept. The lobbies in Arby's tend to look a little more "swank" (HA HA) than most other fast food establishments. They have mood lighting and cooshy benches to sit on while you dine. 

Second - We went and their shake machine was out of business. *womp womp womp*. The entire reason I came was busted, but of course, my husband still wanted a sandwich. We ordered one and a side of Mozzarella Sticks. I know it's just fried cheese and how bad is fried cheese for you? "Really bad Ashley" says my inner organic-food-voice. BUT I don't care. I love fried cheese dipped in marinara sauce! 

Plus the manager here was very nice and offered us two free drinks since I couldn't use my coupon and she was willing to write on my coupon so I could use it at a later date. However, my coupon was not on the verge of expiring so I just said I would come back later.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is where Cafe de japon used to be. They changed it... a lot. This is a good thing. Cafe de japon has been replaced with something much, much better.

Right off the bat, the interior is a revelation over the old one. Everything is redone to a modern and refreshing take on a ramen restaurant. Squared wooden-looking tables, heavy square seats, ramen spoon and napkin presented nicely, and a nice bright interior to match. It actually feels a bit like DW Bistro. Casual and yet upscale in its own way.

The service. As this place is new, it's still being worked out, but I'm pleased to report it is extremely thorough. Almost too thorough. Everything is promptly taken care of. Items come out all at once, with lots of waiters/waitresses. There are little touches involving the service like coming by with black pepper grinders for your carbonara ramen.

Speaking of food...

The pork buns. These were tasty. First bite, you taste the seasoning on the pork. The The rest of the bites, you are greeted with the same tender pork, plus mayo. Usually I'm not a fan of these, but I think these were one of our favorite things. A simple but tasty creation.

The curry. Really smooth and strong curry. Not spicy at all, though the option would be nice. Served with a piece of tender pork, asparagus, and a slice of red bell pepper. Again, simple and to the point. Presented nicely with small portion - closer to a sort of fine-dining experience. I would actually say avoid this for being $8.50 with little more than rice and curry sauce.

The carbonara ramen. So, this is exactly what you think it is. It is carbonara pasta. Even the pork tastes like bacon, not the same pork you are getting in all the other dishes. The bowl is presented with an egg yolk in the spoon. Yup, this is carbonara. Chopped Japanese mint tossed in for an extra hint of flavor. This was not our favorite item because we thought it was out of place. It just wasn't our desired flavor for ramen. If nobody told us it was ramen, we wouldn't know. Portion is relatively small compared to most places. A simple dish outside of the carbonara factor. Also, nearly impossible to eat without splashing broth everywhere. Lastly, this is also expensive.

The shiroi tonkotsu. This is more of the traditional ramen we expected. The noodles were thinner, and the broth was tasty with a creamy texture. Savory without being too salty. More traditional cut of pork over the one in the carbonara. Again, simple. It's the purist's ramen, if you will. It isn't our favorite ramen style.

Again, this is based entirely on the soft opening so take that for what it's worth. If I were to rate Hiromaru on food alone, it would likely be 3 stars. The service and experience, 4.5 stars. For us to return, prices would have to be significantly cheaper considering the sizes/portions and simplicity of it all.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Slimy owner Kami Eshragi tried to give alder Austin King a run for his money in the elections last year, but turned out to be out or touch with students.  After watching his conduct in the election I will never go here again, but when I did it was a dark place with a very diverse crowd.  Eat dinner on huge matresses surrounded by curtains...kinda shady.  Good dance scene.  1 Star</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Freddy's at Elliott and McClintock has only been open a few days and is looking to be a worthy addition to the neighborhood.  The burger was large and thin (having obviously been smashed on the grill); edges were a little crispy and taste was generally quite good. Cheese was melted between the burgers and added some moisture and what my eldest daughter likes to call cheesy goodness.

Fries were  a little disappointing.  While the meat seemed to be of good quality for a fast food place, the fries weren't thin enough to be crispy or thick enough to be tasty.  I don't put catsup on my fries, but these needed it.  They were dry and lacking in taste.

So four stars for the burger, one star for the fries, five stars for pleasant smiling service in a drive thru.  I'd give it 4 1/2 stars.  Since it's new and I'm the first reviewer and I'm delighted to have a new dining option near my home, I'm rounding up to 5 stars.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I happened to be at Boulder Station this morning and in need of a cup of coffee.  It was a perfect day for one as it was cold outside; I was feeling lethargic and beat down.  So my need of caffeine is excusable.  Anyhow, I like this little place.  It wasn't really busy and since I am not one for the GRANDE NON FAT MOCHA MAMA FOOKA'S WITH 1/2 CAF. DECAF AND WHIPPED CREAM ON THE SIDE, a regular drip was my order.  So, Starbucks is Starbucks.  Decent service with a smile in a welcoming well lit environment.  So, all I can tell you is my experience while sipping on my coffee.

I got my cup and sat out in front of Starbucks at a little table and watched everyone walk by me as they were heading to the buffet.  The only noise I heard was the slot machines trying to entice you to play and the sound of footsteps walking by.  I was able to get a little revitalized and get on with my day.  What else do you need?</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Heard that Tom opened a frozen custard shop in Tempe a few days ago, so I decided to check it out after my massage last Wednesday.  The shop just opened up a month ago, and he's still getting signage to come in (lists of toppings and cones, etc.).  Tom encouraged me to try as many flavors as I wanted, so I tried:

Key Lime- excellent!  Sweet and tart, and very refreshing!  My fave of all that I tried, so I bought a pint to take home.  However, I'm exhibiting allergic symptoms every time I eat it- must be the natural flavoring.  I'll need more research.  ;)

Mocha Bean- good, but I wouldn't suggest it after trying an acidic fruity one, like key lime, as the coffee/chocolate will taste "a little off" (my words).

Strawberry- delicious!  And I try to avoid strawberry due to an allergy, yet I ordered this to go into a waffle cone- see photo.  You can see the strawberry puree mixed in the frozen custard.

Vanilla- also very tasty.  Wish I could try some of the toppings, or even just hot fudge mixed in, like a thick milkshake, but the candy bar toppings I saw, as well as the commercial hot fudge that GFC stock and use contain corn syrup and other corn derivatives.

Black Cherry- excellent, and with whole black cherries in the mix!  I don't know why I didn't take a pint home with me... :'(

The following flavors I took home with me without sampling first:

Cinnamon bun- Oh my!  This tasted just like a great cinnamon roll!  It's very rich, though, so I suggest having it in small doses.  Contains real cinnamon- a must-try!  :))

Banana- made with banana puree.  Very good, as well.  Not as sweet as Ben &amp; Jerry's banana ice cream base in Chunky Monkey.  Maybe you can order this with added hot fudge and nuts?  

**Coffee Bean- I'm very partial to coffee ice cream, but GFC's offering is solid.

**Orange Creamsicle- I could definitely taste orange and cream, and I liked the flavor.  I was hesitant to try it, because of my orange allergy, and I wasn't sure if this frozen custard flavor contained actual puree or just flavoring.  Doesn't matter, though, since all "natural flavors" are derived from corn.  

Please note that frozen custard contains more egg yolks AND less air than traditional ice cream, so every flavor will taste richer and creamier and have a denser mouth-feel, and this decadence is not for everyone- my Mom, for example.  (Store-brand ice cream often do not contain eggs, and, forgive the tangent, usually contain corn syrup!  I've had premium ice cream, both organic and non-, that contained egg yolks.)  Some of Glen's Frozen Custard flavors do contain corn syrup, such as chocolate, raspberry, and butterscotch, the latter of which is Tom's favorite flavor, and he's trying to talk me into tasting it "at least once!"  

Btw, the fruity sorbet flavors are blends of frozen custard and "sherbet."  The Key lime, however, tasted and felt like sorbet- very light and cooling-- I felt like I was on a tropical vacation.  :)  

Would I come back if I didn't have food allergy issues?  A resounding yes!  I wish Tom and his family great success with this franchise.  I really wish Tom great success so that he will open non-GMO frozen custard shops in the future.  ;)

** Denotes complimentary items I received.  Thank you for your generosity, Tom!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I've been watching this place out of the corner of my eye since we moved to the neighborhood, and I finally stopped in yesterday to give it a try in my quest to sample all of the local fare around my house (for better or for worse...still haven't gotten up the courage to try Los Betos...). I made myself go to the gym beforehand to earn my treat, and all I could think about was curly slices of gyro meat with each lap in the pool. 

I expected it to be grimy and icky inside, but actually it was clean and the staff was very friendly and welcoming. 

I ordered the gyro with everything, and DH got the Philly cheese steak just the way he likes it, with meat/cheese/bread only. He said it was great; my gyro was solid. 

I couldn't help wondering while I was waiting what the heck they do with that glistening, homogeneously-speckled column of "meat" when they close down for the night...do they wrap it in tin foil and put it in the fridge? Is it so processed that it doesn't even need refrigeration? What IS it?

Whatever, I like gyro meat. It's the Greeks' answer to the hot dog. It's the pita's Velveeta. You don't know what's in it, but you don't care because it's mmmmmmm tasty.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Went shopping here today...not quite Costco or Sam's Club and neither are the prices but some of the items are worth while...my apartment is not big enough for me to buy large quantities of things in bulk so overall, when I can shop here and find something it is cool.

This is a good place I think for the small mom and pop places that have a higher markup than the corporate giants...overall 3 stars..maybe 3 and 1/2 on a good day.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>CZ souper fans rejoice! Cafe Zupas second location here in Henderson is now open! Woo hoo! Soups made in house! Salad dressings made in house. Bread BAKED guess where?  In house! That is what I've come to appreciate about this place.

There are dizzying array of options if you order the 2 Combo. Pick any two items from the following; whole sandwich, 1/2 size portion of soup or salad. At least 7 each of soups, salads and sandwiches to choose from.  It includes a chunk of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry.  A little over $8 for a nice size meal, not too shabby.
 
Soups ....  Lobster Bisque, Roasted Red Pepper &amp; Lobster, Tomato Basil and Wild Mushroom Bisque are my go to for soups. The consistency of them are perfect. Not too thick or watered down. Seasoned just right. Doesn't have a salty taste. You know why? It's made IN HOUSE. Down to the fresh basil added in the Tomato Basil soup!  I can taste the difference between this and the previously frozen stuff with the added preservatives that they dish out at the other chain restaurant.   I also tried Chicken Enchilada Chili soup the other day. That one was really creamy.

Salads ..... my go to was the Vermont Maple Blueberry, but sadly it's been dropped. So now I get either order the Nuts About Berries, which is made pretty similar. And another new favorite Pina Colada!  Macadamia Nuts and toasted  shredded coconut , pineapple, mandarin oranges and a Pina Colada dressing. The dressing is light and on the sweeter side, and guess what? It's made IN HOUSE.

Sandwiches ... I'll gloss over this one since I'm not a big bread fan and the one time I ordered it I thought there was too much bread and not enough meat. (See my orig review from CZ's Eastern location). I pretty much don't eat bread at all. I usually give my piece of bread I get with my meal, away. So if you are dining with me, it'll be your lucky day!

Desserts - I usually pass up since I consider the fresh fruit chocolate covered strawberry my sweet treat.  But I did try the berry creme brulee the other day. It was good. And they have cookie bars that everyone raves about. Million Dollar bars??  They go for a couple dollars not one million...just so you know. 

So been here three times already. First time was for the private preview party they held and then again for lunch and dinner once they opened. All visits the CZ crew has been uber cheerful. Pretty uber staffed too. They are well prepared for crowds for sure. This location feels smaller compared to the other Henderson location, but seating wise, I like the wide booths. The condiment/drink/utensil area is hidden behind the wall divider from main dining area.  You can add flavored syrups to your fountain drinks or iced tea.
 
I'm uber happy! I don't have drive those extra minutes now if I'm feeling I just want a salad and a chocolate covered strawberry.
 
So there you go. Now you know what I think about Cafe Zupas.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I love the jerk chicken and pork. The meat just comes off the bone. The plantanes were superb but be careful with the dipping sauce--SPICY! Décor is a lot of local flavor.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place is awesome!  I wouldn't have thought this was owned by the same company that owns the run down, horrible Copp's by where I live on Shopko Road on the east side. 

The store is very visually appealing. Love that they have an ice cream station a sushi bar and other cool things like where they will cook whatever meat you buy. 

I'd gladly spend a little more to shop at Metro Market if they would put one in place of the nasty Copps on the east side.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I've been coming to this location for two reasons, good service, and entertainment from the bus stop outside.  However, recently, I've experienced not so great service.  Gosh, I wish the teens working at night would just pay attention. Two weeks in a row now I've gotten the wrong order.  
 First one last week, cheesy gordita crunch with chicken. I got a hard shell taco w/ chicken, cheese, and lettuce in it.   Bean and cheese burrito....I got a beef and cheese burrito. Maybe it's my east coast accent? I don't know.   Yesterday, cheesy gordita crunch with chicken. I got a gordita with chicken and cheese. Um hi, either you don't carry that one anymore, or the person reading the recipe does not know what they're doing?  Hard shell chicken taco encased by a soft shell tortilla w/ cheese between the two shells.  What is the issue?  I'm going to try another location until these workers move on to the next job.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I like Walgreens overall. I've used them in AZ, CO, PA and FL, and until I started using this one, never had a problem.

However, in the 9 months I've been here, this one has proven itself more inept than all the other pharmacies I've used in my life...combined. They've lost prescriptions, entered quantity and refill numbers wrong, had their automated system call me saying I had something to pick up when I didn't and not call me when my pills WERE ready (I mentioned this to the pharmacist -- his answer? "It's a multi-million dollar system, so there are bound to be some errors"). They haven't known the answers to some questions, have sent me on a merry chase, have charged me for three nuva-rings when they only gave me one...need I go on?

As soon as this last prescription they've messed up (without telling me) that I'm waiting for comes in, I'll be switching pharmacies. I should have done it months ago. Ugh.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This used to be the closest pub to my old flat, so we would often pop over for some afternoon relief. Its your standard pub, nothing out of the ordinary here folks. The prices are quite good, at one stage they did a 99p glass of wine. Although with ever changing licensing laws, that probably doesn't happen anymore. I used to get a Kopperburg for £2.85 which was pretty reasonable for Edinburgh.

This pub is located just along from Edinburgh bus station, so its a good stop off if you have time to kill before you hop on a bus. Just a relaxed pub which is good for a quick after work drink or a catch up with a friend.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Some of the employees here make excellent sandwiches and are exceptionally polite, the others...not so much. It's pretty hit or miss depending on who's working when you go. 

I like Port of Subs, so I'm happy to have a location near my neighborhood, however I wish the service were more consistent. Both my boyfriend and I have been skimped on veggies so many times, and it's really a frustrating issue when it happens on so many occasions. For me, a sandwich is more about the layers of vegetables and the delicious seasonings with a highlight of cheese, not the other way around, so when I'm offered a few measly slices of tomato it's a little insulting. 

I'm not a high-frequency customer because there's also banh mi and salads up the street, so I only find myself motivated to eat here once in awhile given the competition.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I stopped for breakfast today on a bike ride from Lake Mead Parkway.  I thought riding the 7.5 miles to get here would be a nice place to stop, have some coffee, and a bit of breakfast.

Getting seated was terribly slow.  There was one older person to seat and take payment at the register so things were slow.  By the time I was seated, the line behind me was about 5 couples deep.  I had to wait even though I sat at the counter.

That being said, my server was prompt with the coffee and he took my order quickly, too.  I had a cheese and mushroom omelette, hash browns, and toast.  $8 + with tax.  

This is a fine place for breakfast, and I'd stop here again.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>i like to think of myself as a fairly easy going person that is accepting when things don't go exactly to plan.  however, my last visit to Mother's was a serious test of my patience.

previously i've been a fan of Mother's.  it's a good space that the Yelp book group has found handy for our monthly meetings.  food is good and drinks are reasonably priced, these two points still stand.  however, the real downfall of Mother's is its service.

during our May book group we reserved a table since many of us were planning on eating prior to our cocktail quest.  i arrived just the back of 6pm and proceeded to wait with the others for over 20 minutes to place our orders.  most of us sat for half an hour without a drink and a further half an hour was added to this for two poorly made martinis to arrive, which were apparently warm and one had a rotten olive included.  it was well after 7pm before anyone received starters and as i had only ordered a main i had a further wait to see any sort of food in front of me.  the most insulting part of the evening was that when mains did arrive, one of the orders was wrong.  after waiting over an hour and half for food it was fair to say we were all fairly annoyed, especially so that the waitress argued that she had taken the order right when we had all clearly heard our fellow book grouper order a beef burger not the beef kabobs that she brought.

i do have to say that the food we had was good, i found my chicken, mango, and avocado salad tasty.  but not tasty enough to wait over an hour and a half for, although at that point i was hungry enough that anything would taste amazing!!  there was no apology issued over the order mix up or the extensive time that we had to wait (mind the bar wasn't even busy!!) so once we got our food we paid our bill and swiftly left.  i'm rather disappointed as it's unlikely i'll return to Mother's due to the incredibly poor service as this did appear to be such a promising new bar.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>THIRD TIMES THE CHARM!!!!

Yelpers came out to the South Point Bingo Room in hopes of FINALLY, MAYBE getting a winner!?!?! On our last two outings, our constant hopes of yelling that word
came pretty close, but no cigar....We got situated with our games, drinks, and it was ON!

Off to a slow start, we all patiently waited, daubing away and monitoring our machines, hearing the B word being yelled all around us, thinking "here we go again"  possibly being shafted for the third time with no winners yet again....:(

But Then.....

BEEP!!!(The sound your machine makes when you're one number away)
Hostess Khatherine's machine sounded off, and after a couple of numbers later......
BINGO!!!-Khatherine yelled, and our entire table erupted in cheers! Finally, we had a reason to celebrate! Little did we know what else was in store a few moments later...
BEEP!!! Terri's machine sounded in front of me...and then for the second time...BINGO!!! Our table once again erupts in cheers, not caring that others around us are getting pretty irked as we are celebrating once again We all simmer down and resume play, and after a couple more games pass....BINGO!!! is shouted for the third time from Sandra. Our table gets uncontrollably loud, and this time, our table was "shushed" by one of the workers. OOOOPSY!!!!

A great time was had by those who attended as this UYE  went into overdrive where we celebrated by closing down Art of Flavors yet again, followed by a three hour chow down at Yonaka. Congrats again to all the bingo winners and Thanks to Khatherine for hosting another great evening with awesome peeps and great memories!  ALOHA!!!

    <review:review_text>When going here before a Diamondback game, don't expect fast service.  Sure, they are trying to do all they can, but dang - there are a LOT of you!  Suns games are pretty bad too, though when comparing sold out games, there are just more Diamondback folks trying to get in.  The nice thing is, Suns fans want to get out of there and head over before tip off.  Most Baseball fans will head over where whenever they're done because they know they have a good 8 hours to go.

Ok, lots of sports detail I know.  But w/ Jackson's on 3rd, it's all about Sports.  If you're thinking of heading over, check the sports schedules in the area before you make any firm plans. 

Besides that - huge bar.  When it's empty (a non-game day) it seems even bigger.  But that can work great if you want to meet a crowd there for a non-sports event.  The dance club space has been a bit more hit and miss over the years.  It went from lame to cool to not so hot to, well maybe if we're in the area anyhow...  Who knows where it will be when you go, but it's a decent sized space, a big bar and a good amount of seating so you'll definitely get your drink on, even if you don't get your groove on.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>AMAZING. My family has been looking for some real frozen custard since moving to AZ a year ago and after many disappointments we found it at Glen's. We tried it for the first time last week and will definitely be back for more!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Yay!!! SO HAPPY they've opened a location in central Phoenix! Super cute decor, same awesome flavors as their original location in Scottsdale.  

I was so happy to see they had Honey Lavender in the case today, their grand opening! Creamy, delicate flavors. My 5 yr old daughter chose the Lemon Shiso (Lemon plus a Japanese herb-like leaf...delicious flavor, but I'm surprised she chose that, as it usually appeals to a more mature palate! My girl's got great taste!) 

Also, this new location accepts all major credit cards, including AMEX!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>They forgot an important ingredient in the original dog-   hot peppers on the side! 
Of course I got my dog to go so was without peppers. Not a good first visit.
The dog was tasty and an average size portion for $4.99. They have Krispy Kremes (glazed only) also which is always a plus.
Will I return for another dog? It is a convenient location, so perhaps.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I was a longtime customer of this restaurant and have gone through several changes of management.

The current menu is limited but the best choice is the filet mignon. The food is good but they sometimes forget to completely finish the the order.

However the current staff needs some work. The host is completely clueless. The chef cannot remember you from one week to next as he visits each table (even after months of patronage0.. The wait staff makes minor but annoying mistakes.

I used to go every week but I don't think I will go back for a while</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Anyone from Chicago can appreciate Chicagoland Hotdogs &amp; more. The classic hot dogs/jumbo dogs, Italian beef, and cheese fries will make you feel like you're right back at home in the Midwest. I also love that soda is still considered 'pop' and the walls are covered in Chicago sports memorabilia.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This was totally our after work hang out.  On a rough day, it might be the "lunch" for some.  As long as you could walk over and walk back, which we did, you were good.  

I was surprised by their food.  They aren't going to win any gourmet awards or anything, but it was pretty good for bar food.  And they had some good weekly specials.  They also did regular Texas Hold em Tournaments which were fun to watch.  Small neighborhood spot.  Great service.  Good drink prices.  And for some of us - great memories.  (Shout out to my Synergy Homies!)</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Joes is my new go to place for Chinese food. Although I miss the Hong Kong Wok at Hilldale mall Joe provides a flavor that is similar if not better in most cases. He also saves me a trip to Middleton because he also sells roasted pork and duck. Like most foodies you dislike when your newfound eateries become populated, but I have learned from the closing of Viet House (that sold maybe the best bahn mi in town and a pho second to Saigon noodles) that it is better to share my indulgences just to keep them around. 
Let us hope Joe sticks around
Joes wife Jennie is a charm.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>So I finally gave in to my curiosity about this "major LA tradition" and wow, I was so disappointed! Here's the quick rundown... First, its WAAAY on the east side of town, not worth the drive just for the experience, so save your gas money and time. Second, the burger meat itself - maybe .175 mil thick, I mean thin. Where's the beef? Not here! RIDICULOUS. My double burger when taken as a complete unit, tasted of mustard, dill pickle and chili-goo. There is no grilled beef flavor, nothing more than mustard and pickleness. Folks seem to speak highly of the chili fries, so while I've never in my life ordered that particular item from anywhere, I decided to make it a first (along with my first Tommy's visit). THAT is comfort food. It is everything I imagine one would want in a Cheese Fries - salty-crispy-cheesey-thick chili - its like a big thick food blanket. I forced from my mind the thought of, "how many calories are probably in this danger food?" ... all for the sake of my fellow Yelpers. Yes, its all for you! ;)

Anyway... bottom line, In-N-Out is where you need to go if you want anything short of a gourmet burger, that tastes like a burger. Animal style, oh yeah. If you need a fast-food-level chili fix, Wienershnitzel is your place. They have a chipotle chile thing now, and to tell you the truth, it is almost identical to Tommy's chili. They probably source it from the same company. My Tommy's experience sat in my gut, uncomfortably so, for about 5 hours. I'm not used to eating such heavy food, an I will tell you that the other folks at Tommy's that evening seemed to have a BMI of over 40. That should tell you a lot.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This bar/restaurant can't be missed, with it's rich exterior and important position right next to the Edinburgh Playhouse! 

It definitely fancier, and much larger, than many of the other bars and pubs in Edinburgh and has an enviable menu as well. Now that it's summertime, the outdoor seating is extremely tempting and I have to say I succumbed! The food is surprisingly inexpensive, and I had a delicious chicken burger with my beer. They also serve mains (I noticed they do a lot of fish dishes, haddock, salmon etc) as well as salads and pretty good-looking desserts... 

It's extremely cosy indoors, but I'm not sure much sunlight is allowed in there, so I'd definitely recommend heading there whilst the weather permits!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>If you read enough of my Yelp reviews, you'll notice that my second home is the crappiest dive I can find. Pomeroy's is no exception. I started coming here because my friends live within walking distance and is where they like to go. To be fair, I've never actually gone there on my own (without them) so I cant say I really choose the place. The bartenders are very very quick to remember your name and your drink, even though by the end of the night I always forget their names. The selection of games (shuffleboard, darts, pool, and arcades) is very good and worth the entertainment factor in their own. You never know what kind of crowd will be there, but mostly it is not a good one. I've had a lot of people try to start fights here, it's just a seedy and unruly bunch. That all said, overall I think it's an ok place to drink. It's inexpensive and the bartenders are great, and when it's all said and done, thats what matters the most about a bar.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I like Jamba Juice.

I like this particular location as well.

Like Alicia, the place was JAMbING loud with music-- like really loud, like I thought I turned into my parent's b/c I almost wanted to say, "Can you turn the music down, it's hurting my ears."

I bit my tongue and anxiously awaited for my Orange-A-Peel.  It was good.  It was exactly what I expected and wanted at that very moment. 

Clean, nice staff, good smoothie.  Just loud.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Fairly decent upscale Southwestern spot.  Great margaritas and nice outdoor dinning area.  The enchilidas were good, although I think I prefer the preparation at an authentic Mexican restaurant.

The fried wonton "tortilla" chips and salsa were an excellent starter.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We are so happy to have a German restaurant so close to home now. Our first visit was during their first week after opening. The waiter was very friendly and helped offer suggestions from the menu. They have German beer and wine selections available that both of us enjoyed. My wife ordered the schnitzel with mushroom sauce and I ordered the sauerbraten. Both were prepared quickly and we enjoyed every bite. This will definitely be a do-over for us so we can try more of the menu.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Ended up here at 10pm because everything else was closed. An underwhelming Italian with undercooked calzone and soggy spaghetti. On the positive side, it was only £30 for two people including some of their house wine. Overall, I won't be back if I can avoid it.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Places like Cruising 7th play an important role in the natural ecosystem of the GLBT world.  For one thing, it provides a natural hunting grounds for the transexualis anacondis, a rare creature indeed that is seven feet tall, looks like a giant woman but has a schlong wider than a beer can and longer than a salami.  Seriously, it's an okay place.  The motto should be:  Don't lick anything with your tongue.  My modus operandi:  Get in, get yer drink, watch the fun shows and get out.  The drag shows can be quite entertaining.  Play some pool if you can.  And, if you are partial to miniskirts and fetish boots, this is the place to see and be seen.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Yum!
Stopped in after a WestWorld event. This was some seriously good pizza. The crust was crisp and the sauce and toppings were good. Just the right amount of cheese.

It seemed like they were a little unorganized, which we later found out that they've just re - opened. There are still a few timing kinks to work out, but the food was delicious. I had a couple of slices and the hubs had wings.

These slices were so good that I can't wait to try a whole pie! Unfortunately they aren't nearby our home, but this won't be my last WestWorld event so I'll be back.

(They're closed on Sundays, bummer because I would have made my next visit today after WW)</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>As a New Orleans native, I am going to hold any "cajun" restaurant to the highest standard. 3 stars in this case is actually a huge compliment from me because I expect a lot when ordering this kind of food. 

I had the shrimp po boy and seafood gumbo...I have to say, both were quite tasty. Is the po boy equivalent to my favorite place in NOLA? Of course not - the bread would be slightly different, and the lettuce should be shredded. Does it do the trick for a quick fix? Absolutely. The seafood gumbo was actually pretty delicious as well - I was impressed with that dish for sure. Someone at my table ordered jambalaya, and he said he loved it...but my husband's looks a lot more appetizing.

I will definitely come back here during crawfish season to see what that's like....depending on how well they do that, I might even add a star. The service is friendly but a little slow.

This place is not the nicest restaurant or the nicest ambiance, so don't come here expecting a 5 star experience. However, it does a pretty damn good job of making a native New Orleans girl feel slightly at home in this crazy desert. I had a positive experience and am eager to check out some more of what Baby Kay's has to offer.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Let me start with RAVE reviews for the staff.  We stopped by last night (Fri) at 7:30 and the place was packed. We were informed that this was a 'soft opening' but the buzz is clearly out there. They don't even have the sign up over the door yet. 

From the moment we stepped in, the front desk staff were informative, attentive and offered great suggestions for food.  Our server (Nikki) was efficient and suggested 3 really good wines to go with our food.  They were out of a few food items and the staff was very apologetic about it. We had no trouble making a couple selections from what they still had.   

I ordered the green apple and fennel salad and will make the drive back there just for that item alone. Cheers to the creator of that mix of sweet, tart and crunchy goodness!  Then we tried the braised beef Panini. Beef was melt in your mouth but I'd suggest taking that out of the panini and giving it a place of honor on top of a pile of mashed potatoes with a veggie side. My companions ordered the Caprese Salad and rated it 'good' because after tasting my Apple Fennel salad, well, nothing was as good as that. 

This place is way out in the foothills and a bit beyond my normal HH range but I'll be back again in a few weeks to see how they are doing.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>this is one of my favorite breakfast spots in all of madison. it looks like it's right out of new york, but has such a great european flavor. their almond french toast (i can't remember the exact name, and surprisingly, it's not listed on their menu online) is INCREDIBLE. everytime i'm in madison on a saturday or sunday morning, i want to be here. 

the hostess on those mornings is phenomenol. and the waitstaff is incredibly friendly and helpful. i LOVE it.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>What a mess of a hotel. I guess that maybe I grew up in an era where the Marriott name meant class and luxury. 
I can't blame Marriott for the fact that the hotel was hosting the Little Miss (Jon Benet) America contest. The hotel was overran with 6 year olds wearing make up and donning skimpy outfits. It's disturbing that Parent's lives are so unfulfilled that they have to dress their children like Cocktail waitresses at a seedy bar. 
The hotel was totally booked. You had ten floors worth of rooms, but yet the hotel only had two elevators. It was pretty annoying to wait 15 minutes every time you wanted to go up to your room. 
And the kicker was on Sunday morning when we wanted to have breakfast at the hotel restaurant. The hotel had nobody on duty to bus tables, so while it was obvious that the restaurant was half empty, but there was a 15 minute wait to be seated. Of course the hostess acted like an office temp, with a bad attitude. That was a perfect ending to our hell stay at the Marriott-Madison West. I couldn't check out of that hotel fast enough. 
In the future, I would rather stay at a hotel with sticky sheets, that rents it's rooms by the hour than ever stay at a Marriott again.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We visited Phoenix Produce Company as part of the "First Ever" Explore SoDo Tour.  

The owners were very friendly and gracious.  They gave us a brief history of the building and provided an interesting assortment of refreshments.  We enjoyed a pomegranate-grapefruit juice, spongecake, fig newtons, grapes and some sort of fruit with a tough outer coating and a clear inner fruit that was vaguely sweet.  I have no idea what the hell it was.

Phoenix Produce also sells E-Bikes.  They are apparently the only importer of these in the Phoenix area.  We got a walk-through of one of the E-bikes, showing us where the drive was (in the rear hub), the batteries (3, 36v), how it operates, maximum speed (20-22mph), maximum range (27 miles), price (about $475 before tax), etc.  Then we all got to take one out for a test drive.  Awesome!  I was impressed and would seriously consider one of these for urban living.

My 12 &amp; 15 year old daughters thoroughly enjoyed the test rides as well and would have done nearly anything to leave Phoenix Produce on one of these bikes.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is my favorite Mexican lunch destination downtown. I've started coming here once or twice a week because they have a huge, cheap, and pretty interesting menu as well as a great bakery.

The one star off is unfortunately for the main course there. There has always been something a little off in everything I or someone else gets there when I've gone. They have great freshly made tortillas, but the filling for the Vegetarian is pretty bland if you ask me. A friend got a Carne Asada burrito and he said the meat was pretty fatty. They have an interesting selection of tamales but they've all been kindof bland as well. The tacos have always been the best, but it's pretty hard to screw up a taco.

But they have a whole bunch of unexpectadly weird dishes for a cheap counter service Mexican place like Potato tortas and aforementioned large tamale selection including fruity tamales that make it so you can have something different every time you come. 

But my favorite part is getting something from the bakery after the meal. Check out the pic on their website of their selection, it is very impressive. The highlight for me is the carmel filled churros, which when served fresh, will make you see God.

They have  a cool market with hard to find tools to make your own Mexican feast, a meat counter, and rockin' Horchata too.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Sweet Republic is great, I love that they use all natural ingredients and they really try to bring new flavor combinations and profiles to the public.  The owners are pretty darn nice and the store is much roomier than their closest competition (Churn on Central).  

I can find nothing to fault about the store and their product!

We have options near the central corridor when it comes to ice cream, but for my money I think Sweet Republic is gunning for the top spot.  Their space is more accommodating, their flavors are more unique and their quality is top notch.

Do yourself a favor and order the roasted homemade marshmallow on top!  And while you are at it, tell them Tim sent you! (They wont have any idea who Tim is by the way...)</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I am from Phoenix, moved to the Bay Area 7 years ago... I have only been to Ike's in California, but I am sooooo excited they opened one in my home state. They're sharing the love!  
The sandwiches are incredible. The selection is extensive and they can make things vegetarian/vegan style if you request. You even get a caramel apple lollipop in your meal (I hope they do this in AZ). 
Don't hesitate - RUN to Ike's and get the best sandwich of yo' life!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>(Impression mainly from soft opening)

Note: You should love the noble piglet! Pork and pork based items dominates ~96% of their non-beverage menu.

There has been a lot of buzz regarding the opening of Hiromaru Fusion Ramen since the Ramen Festival at the Rio last year. And finally they are opened for business! Excited!!!

What I love about this type of ramen restaurants is the fact that their menu is so simple and straightforward. Just four (4) ramen to select from, and whether to upgrade some add-ons to the ramen (extra Chashu, roasted seaweed and even cheese!), or side orders of Gyoza, Chashu Pork Bowl, Karaage, Curry and Hiromaru Buns. None of that 150 menu items from your typical Chinese American Take-Out restaurants, or the 10 page menus at older American diners. Essentially their laser focus attention to making what few items they have on their menu to the highest degree of expertise their kitchen crew can mustered on a daily basis is what I admire. 

So here is what you can order from their 1 page menu:

Carbonara Ramen ($10.95) - the chef's signature fusion ramen inspired by the Italian Carbonara pasta. The soup base consist of Tonkotsu pork broth and milk (expect watery broth and not thick traditional Carbonara pasta sauce). It is topped with still runny egg yolk, bacon, Shio and fresh scallions, resulting in a beautiful presentation of yummy ramenness.  Flat thick noodle is served with this bowl of ramen, I assume to better grip the creamy fusion ramen broth, but eating this without making any unintentional splashes is very difficult. If you can manage that difficult task, mad props to you Ninja!

Shiroi Tonkotsu ($7.95) - according to the Chef and the menu, "the best salted ramen is created with salted sauce and brown garlic oil."  I have not heard or read otherwise, so I shall defer to the ramen expert on this one. This most traditional of the 4 ramen options is served with Tonkotsu pork broth with salted sauce. Chashu pork, hard boiled egg, fresh scallions and Kikurage tops thin ramen noodles to complete this entree. The soup is delicious (at my limit for how salty I like my ramen broth), but I prefer slightly thicker and chewier ramen.

Kuroi Tonkotsu ($8.95) - this is a special salted ramen made with Chef Kawai's master's secret "Ma-Yu" (black garlic oil) recipe.  It is essentially the Shiroi Tonkotsu with the special ma-yu.

Tate-Yama Ramen ($9.95) - easily the tallest ramen you can order from the menu, which is inspired by the largest mountain in Chef Kawai's home prefecture. The double portion of thick ramen (aka Kaedama) and mounds of vegetables (bean sprouts &amp; cabbage), is served with a soy sauce base + salted sauce and baby-backbone fat, Chasu, hard-boiled egg.

The typical ramen-ya side dishes are available for ordering and some. The Hiromaru Buns (steamed buns + Butabara pork belly in original Hiromaru sauce) sounds amazing and tasted as good as it looks! The Japanese mayo with the lettuce was an interesting creamy touch.  Chicken Karaage was fried nicely, but still moist inside and is perfect as is or with a light squeeze of lemon.

No alcohol is served, at least not now, but sodas and teas and bottled water are available to help lower the sodium concentration is your stomach.

The decor is simple and modern, they really did a great job renovating the space vacated by Cafe de Japon. Even the large "private" room off to the side looks nice and inviting, and ready to accommodate patrons.

Fast service, yummy food and attentive staff, so far so good! Ramen portion is average or slightly smaller, I can do 2 bowls for sure, maybe 3 bowls when I am in beast mode. So the 2x ramen noodle option at the time you place your order is recommended if you frequent food eating contests.

5 ramen spoons outta 5.

    <review:review_text>I agree with Amy here, it's a good place if you're waiting on the next bus home.

The only thing I have to add is that all the locks on the toilet stalls are busted. The only way to close the door is place a foot on the door, sometimes two and hope to god nobody comes in. 

Doing this for two minutes while sitting on the toilet, earned me entry into the Moscow State Gymnastics Team. Now the next time someone busts in on me, I can distract them with my Gold Medals.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The owner and his son stopped at my workplace with a box of samples earlier this week, along with a flier advertising 30% on May 30th...the samples were delicious, so I figured, what the heck?  I'm so glad I decided to go!  The store smells amazing even as you are walking up.  We were greeted kindly and offered samples.  We ended up walking out with a half dozen, very reasonably priced.  

These doughnuts are the absolute best I have had since I moved away from my hometown bakery 7 years ago.  Soft, incredibly flavorful, and so obviously made fresh and with care.  The lemon filling was lovely, sweet and zippy with actual zest in it; the blueberry filling had actual blueberries.  The apple fritter was delicious--the ones from the grocery store never seem to have quite enough cinnamon for my taste, but these were perfect.  They even have my favorite cinnamon-sugar cake doughnuts, that taste exactly like the ones I grew up getting from my small-town orchard bakery.

This place is a great addition to the neighborhood, and you can bet I'll be back for more!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Weak.  This place is a far cry from the Mill Ave. location in Tempe.  Gone now.  Long Wong's quality is lost on this place.  I had pizza and wings and my slice was literally microwaved to heat it up after I ordered.  Bad, bad, bad.  Wings have always been decent, but there's really no reason to go there ever again.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I have only been here for Happy Hours - so this is only a review for HH offierings and experiences.

Two visits - the first was a party of five, the second a party of six.

Since Embassy provides Happy Hour for guests of the hotel (in another location, I am guessing), there was almost no one in the lobby bar, which is also the bar for Omaha Steakshouse.

Drinks:  I ordered a whiskey and coke ($5.00 well drinks), and the bartender asked if I'd prefer ginger ale.  While I adore a good whiskey and ginger, most bars don't have REAL ginger ale - so I rarely order it.  As a bartender, I know I only make suggestions to change a customers order if we are out of the requested item or if I feel it will make the drink that much better.  I didn't imagine they could be out of Coke - so I am guessing it was a suggestion for improvement and I agreed to it.  GOOD CALL!  Not only was real ginger ale used - the angel behind the bar muddled in some fresh ginger for me, too!  YUM!
My companions had assortments of house wines, margaritas and beer.  Everyone was happy.
The food offerings are all appetizer sized and perfect for sharing.  And, only $5.00 during Happy Hour!
The wings are wings - nothing disappointing, but nothing to write home about.
The Buffalo Chicken Sliders were tasty - but the bread was really the standout part of this dish, and I did appreciate the large chunks of bleu cheese in the dressing.
The Hamburger Sliders are wonderful!  You can tell they are fresh grinding the meat from the quality beef they use.  The onions are sauteed to perfection and the buns are fresh, warm and the perfect golden brown.  Three to a plate - we had to order a second round of these!
Pulled pork sliders were unremarkable, but okay.  (Like the wings.)  There was nothing wrong with them - and at $5 for three sliders, I have no right to expect an epiphany.
I can't do our last dish justice.  It's homemade potato chip "nachos" with a bleu cheese sauce.  Honestly, despite having shared two orders of these on my first visit and one the second, I don't remember what else is on them but WOW - this is comfort food at its best and I can't wait to go back for more!

The room is not a typical hotel lobby.  There is a huge koi pond running throughout the lobby, and tall tropical trees.  I felt as if I was in a far cooler and more tropical area  - it was easy to forget I was in mid town Phoenix.

It seems this happy hour is still unknown - very few other people there for either visit.  But - I happen to adore the lack of loud music and ability to get top notch service - so that's not a complaint from me!

If they stretch happy hour to 7 instead of 6, I will gladly add on that elusive 5th star!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Boy they really do treat you like gringos in here, sat down at the bar seating area no one greeted us (which didn't bother me I know places can be busy) sit down the kind red headed bus boy brought us chips and salsa and water sat for another 15 minutes no menus, saw people sit down at the actual bar and get drinks and menus right away so my boyfriend and I move to the bar, sat there for another 15 minutes no menus but got a smile from the bartender (which was enough, I'm a server I get busy too so I understand) then two guys sit down at the end of the bar and get menus and drinks right away... This is when I stood up and said this is "bull shit" and left... I will never come back to this place again... But it makes me feel good as a person that I'm a better server than the three "servers" that we're working the bar area</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I went to Bound by Salvatore for a late night stop.  All I have to say is that this bar is perfect for me.

Lots of plush seating, friendly bartenders and wait staff, very unique cocktail menu, and it's a really great spot for people watching at The Cromwell.

Since I like to stay up late in Vegas, my favorite part of their cocktail menu is that they have some really good espresso cocktails!  They're perfect for when you've had a long night on the Strip but want to keep it going just a while longer.

The "Never Say Goodnight" --  http://bit.ly/1mn6TUe
Red Bull Flavored Espresso, Stole Vanil Vodka, Perond Absinthe, Sugar Syrup and Spices
Just by reading the ingredients alone you can tell this is a serious wake-up drink.  This definitely kept my night going and the taste of this cocktail was pretty good!

I will definitely be coming back here again next time I visit Vegas.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>OMG! 
Finally. 
A juice bar that serves fresh REAL LIVE fruits and veggies......
((((((NOTE: this is not your ordinary mall, chain, frozen sweetened fruits from unknown origins-smoothie bar that serve frozen sweetened colored pre mashed yucky stuff.))))

This is the REAL DEAL in VEGAS! Beyond Organic!!!
( California TOP SHELF fruit that the Chefs use on the strip at the top restaurants- From Carrie Klasby (sp?) the intuitive forager.(TIP: Downtown 3rd street farmers market on Fridays FYI )
This is the real deal. Real fresh fruit and vegetables from farms and farmers that are
sourced and brought here directly! 
When you step into the shop you are immediately greeted with an assortment of the most colorful tasty fruits and vegetables found in Vegas. 
So many choices,  including soups!!!
I had the holy grail, and it filled my tummy and made me feel good after a workout. They have an extensive menu- so I will have try them all!!!

TIP: I would call ahead and have your order waiting for pick up...( I haven't tried this yet but the space is tight so this may be a solution to the space issue)

    <review:review_text>Itzza Pizza is the replacement for Gumby's on Madison's near west side

I had the chicago style stuffed pizza and it was good (very big!), but nothing like authentic gino's east or lou malnati's in chicago. The sauce, crust, cheese, and toppings were pretty average and what you would find at places like pizza di roma or glass nickel, at a little cheaper price.

The one thing this place has that no one else does: PEPPERONI ROLLS. Gumby's had them and they were the best and these are even better!! They're soft, chewy, and come with a side of what tasted like thousand island dressing with a kick. Very awesome.

I would rank this place average in every single quality: taste, presentation, location, delivery speed. But the pepperoni rolls won me over. Definitely worth a try.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>And so begins a series of reviews about dairy... from Maidon's newest non-dairy eater. (that's me) 

Ironic?

Chocolate Shoppe is bomb if you're a fan of flavors but don't really care about aesthetics. The inside is a little dingy, I wouldn't say grimy, that makes it sound like the place needs a good scrubbin' and that's not the case. It just needs a little TLC. Perhaps some paint and some new furniture would give the place the breath of fresh air it needs. There's a decent amount of seating outdoors though, and that's nice to sit, lick, watch the world go by. 

But let's talk about the important stuff, the ice cream. One word for ya, and not even a real one ZOREO. Shiz is bomb. They take their dark DARK chocolate ice cream and wrap in marshmallow and oreo cookies. What? Huh? It's true. And it's awesome. 

I'll be back to try other flavors and update this bad boy accordingly, but let's be honest CS, you can only go up from here.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I haven't been to this location as much as I have some of the other locations but I do enjoy this location. Again they are all kind of the same in a sense but its about the interior and the experience. I actually quite like the people who work at this location. I have seen the same people working here for a while now and they always make me feel so welcome. They are usually a couple of early 30's to middle aged women working here that make ya feel like mom is welcoming you home. "What can I get ya hun," "How's your day going sweety," that kind of stuff. And some people may not like that but I enjoy it because it makes you feel way more comfortable to be somewhere. They are always fast and efficient and any extras you may want are stocked plentifully. The one small thing I don't like is that they are tucked away and really have to be looking for it to know where it is and it is sort of a small building. It can get really cramped if there is a line in there and pushed against some of the valuables. Nice place to stop after some shopping if ya know where it is.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This isn't the kind of place I would usually go into, but for Yelp I made the effort. I walked in to find the entire bar watching a darts game between 2 of the locals...

Me and my friend grabbed a seat in the corner and had a little chat. Suddenly an old man who was flirting dangerously close to jaundice, interpreted me and asked, no, plain told me to keep it down. Apparently whispering put off the darts players. I finished my drink and made my way out.

If you like sitting watching darts and not communicating with your loved ones, I recommend here!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>07/15/07

The quintessential New York Deli...or at least what I am told one should be (having never visited New York).  

Solid, satisfying, hot and cold sandwiches with a variety of potato and salad (macaroni, etc.) side options.  Cafeteria style, so know what you want by the time you get to the counter.  It's a great place to go on Sunday morning and read the paper while you enjoy a carved sandwhich.  Of course, there is nothing heathy about any of this food, but it's solidly tasty and satisfying.  Slightly pricey (hot dog special is a good economic choice), but the atmosphere is relaxing, always clean, consistent quality, and they have free self-service water, so you don't have to bother with getting back into line if you're still thirsty.  

What makes it unique is its authenticity and distinction from chain and fastfood stores.  It's not particularly interesting food, just good to satisfy your deli cravings.  Plus, I believe it's locally owned with gives it actual personality.

Come on Sunday and then walk down to PetCo. (or is it Petsmart?) and visit the adoption dogs.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Quite a good chicken parmesan hero for lunch which kicks this place up a star. The cutlets were thin and well breaded and the sandwich had enough sauce and cheese to satisfy this diner. They have two sizes, but you might as well go for the 10 inch hero at 7.95 which is just a buck more than than the 6 inch version. Ordered the fries also at $1.25, but I already knew they were the frozen variety. Still, they were well cooked and crunchy crinkle cut style.

    <review:review_text>A far cry from the South Scottsdale location. The wings I ordered were ice cold! when I brought them back to the counter, the lady said nothing and threw them into a microwave. I kid you not! If you want good wings, try another location. PROS : I didn't get e-coli.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I've been here quite a few times this month for Februany, aka $5 footlongs for anything except premium subs. Since it's the closest spot to my home, I think it's about time they got a review.

The service is consistently fast, and the food is just fine. I've also had no problems redeeming my survey code for a free cookie (if you don't know what that is, check the back of your receipt next time). Preparation seems pretty consistent except for one occasion where they might have skimped a bit on my chipotle mayo. It's kinda small, but aren't they all? Only things stopping this from being a 5 star are that it's a fast food chain restaurant and that the white guy (haven't caught his name) constantly tries to upsell. He asks if you want more cheese and whatnot, and it gets annoying.

Note to self: keep getting my sub toasted because it seems that it's $5.41 for both toasted and untoasted.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The Brass Tap just opened in Mesa Riverview right across from the theatre. They have 60 beers on tap and countless others by the bottle. The focus is American beers, but they have enough variety to satisfy even the avid beer snob. 
I ordered the ham and cheese panini which comes with some amazing tangy honey mustard sauce that I would have bought by the bottle if it was possible. The bread was more like sandwich bread than a traditional panini...but really who cares. It tasted great, and this place is about the beer not the food. 
The bartender was friendly and helpful, even as she politely fielded some drunk dudes hitting on her. 
They have discount nights for first responders (mon), teachers (fri), restaurant workers (sun), and others. I will definitely be back.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is probably your mother's and father's grocery store. In other words, if you want lots of flash and sizzle and the sounds of the rainforest echoing over your produce as the fake spritzer goes off, this is not your scene. This is my neighborhood grocery store, and I like it because it's walkable and bikeable. The entire staff have watched my kid grow from the time she was a baby. They know her name, they know mine. When's the last time you could say that about your local grocery? Meats are very good, produce serviceable, and soda is often on sale at ridiculously low prices. I get annoyed at people who refer to it as the "ghetto grocery" which implies it is overpriced and perhaps doesn't have the class of people you'd like to hang with. This store is as safe as any other store and the people care. I would like to see them utilize their wacky frontage for some tables and chairs so people can sit down, eat, and socialize.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We had intended to go to another restaurant in the area that we discovered was closed. So, we thought we would try this new place and were pleasantly surprised. I had the corned-beef hash wrap from the breakfast menu and it was delish! It came with a generous side of fruit. My companions had the bleu cheese bacon burger and the roast beef baguette. My only complaint is that they don't have brewed iced tea. Otherwise, we had no problems and would definitely return.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>My friends and I just left the Phoenix Open and after a long day of walking all we were looking forward to was sitting down for some food and cold drinks.  We hadn't planned on that taking an hour and a half so that was really unfortunate.

When we came in we decided to sit at a booth because it was pretty chilly out.  It wasn't too busy, but we only counted 3 servers.  I think that was what caused the majority of our problems...

It took our waitress like 10 minutes before she came over to greet us with our bottle of water and glasses.  Because it took a while for her to came over we ordered drinks and chips and salsa.  Drinks took another 15 minutes so by the time they came we had already finished with our chips and were so hungry we almost ate the paper.  

Two of our friends ordered the tacos which they said were decent.  I ordered the tinga burrito bowl.  Luckily the meat was good because the black eyed peas were an awkward addition and the rice was hard.  My other friend ordered the nachos (with no meat) which also had the strange black eyed peas and some cheese sprinkled on them.  So unfortunate the food was a flop. Bland.

She didn't come back to check on us very often and we noticed two other tables complaining from the same issue, different server.  Seems like they were understaffed and it impacted the service in a BAD way.  

It's unfortunate we didn't like it here because we were excited about the new location and the cool new look.  We left saying we wouldn't come back.  Hopefully after a while of being back up and running they will get things going a bit better, I'm not opposed to giving it another shot.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>'Meh' really is the perfect way to describe this Starbucks. I would be lying if I didn't admit that I am a bit of a sucker for Starbucks, despite being of course a huge chain, their high prices and tax-avoiding ways. 
I am willing to cough up a little more for a coffee and cake sometimes, even as a student, especially when the place has a nice atmosphere, maybe some comfy seats to read a book and some space to get some work done for uni.

However this Starbucks really just is quite 'meh'. There isn't anything particularly wrong with it as such, but it is not the kind of the place that I want to spend much of my time in. 

It was very clean, the coffee was very nice and the staff were all very friendly &amp; helpful when I went in but this Starbucks just isn't anything very special.

The truth is that there are much nicer Starbucks in Edinburgh (any many beautiful, cheaper and nicer independent coffee shops but that is a completely different point) such as the one of the Royal Mile. I would definitely recommend other branches over this one.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I was referred here for my husband to get LASIK by a good friend who works in an optometrist department. She said that the treatment and doctor were the best and there were plenty of other LASIK centers that she had seen substandard results from. Noting this, we went to BDP for a free consultation expecting the best. What we got was the worst. 
Making the appt was easy and the people on the phone were pleasant. However, when we got into the office, they acted like we couldn't afford the procedure and therefore weren't worth the time. They didn't explain any of the tests they did, nor did they talk to my husband the entire 2 hours he was there. When my husband tried to ask questions, he was ignored. When the doctor saw him, it wasn't any better. He was brief and to the point. My husband required PRK LASIK and it would be about $4000. When my husband tried to ask a question or inquire about the vision for life program, he was told quickly about the medications he would need to purchase in addition to the procedure. The doctor then promptly closed his folder and left. 
In contrast to this, we visited another LASIK doctor with good ratings and were treated like we were worth his time, explained everything to, and talked to thoroughly about the procedure and medications. They never once left us in the dark, nor did they treat us substandard. The price was the same as BDP, the difference was in how we were treated. Sadly, I was excited to go to BDP and now will not due to their attitudes towards us.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Have to say this is the best Indian food we have had in Arizona. Service was incredible with a waiter who shared information on different dishes and their ingredients as well as a history of the foods. It is rare that you can eat out and have better food than home cooked! Prices were good considering the excellent quality of ingredients. So worth the visit....ask for James, he is amazing.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>While Ajo Al's easily holds the crown for most bearable tex-mex food in town, imho, I still am a far cry from a big fan of here. 

One of my best friends LOVES this place. LOVES it. And I could never figure out why, but I have since turned him onto El Molino in Scottsdale and I haven't heard much about Ajo Al's lately, so maybe he just didn't know any better.

Also, I did hear murmurings of trouble with health code violations here a few months back. Those usually don't scare me too much, in all candor, since perfectly good restarants get the whistle blown on them for relatively minor infractions so often that I've grown somewhat callous to their warnings. 

Further, I'm sure any problem that once existed is now long gone since there was some press about the incident when it happened. 

A good after work place to grab a drink or watch the game with friends, but do yourself a favor and grab some authentic mexican that us Phoenicians are blessed with when it comes time to eat.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Quick and dirty review: Perhaps one of the best fish frys in Madison, featuring Baby Pike, Cod, and Perch.  Decent sides, cheap drinks, decent service, but extremely tiny and easily packed - especially on Friday nights.

Detailed review: the fish fry fanatics crew selected Toby's Supper Club as the target for our taste buds this week.  We were "warned" by a co-worker that it was a "local/townie" type place, but it didn't deter us.  We ventured out to Toby's, found a parking spot, and muscled our way into the place.

I say "muscled" because the place was PACKED.  We arrived at around 7:30pm that evening; we didn't get seated at a table until nearly 10:00pm... It was ridiculously full.  And hot.  Too many people and not enough A/C, for sure!

Despite the packed-to-the-gills nature, we were quickly served by the bartenders.  Talk about "machines" - the two folks that were tending the bar were going non-stop, multi-tasking, and never missing a beat.  May not have been the friendliest service, but they were literally giving change while mixing a drink and taking at least 2 additional orders... all at once.  Free pretzels were a nice touch as well.

Oh, and did I mention the drinks were cheap?!  Whiskey Old Fashioned Sour: $3.  Beers - dunno, but we drank for 3 hours on $30.  That's good by my book.

The ordering process is interesting... you'll be sitting/standing at the bar, and out of nowhere will appear a waitress.  She'll take your order and will then grab you when your food and table are both ready.  We ordered: Baby Pike, Cod, and Lake Perch with a side of cheesy hashbrowns.

As mentioned, the wait was incredibly long - at least 2.5 hours.  But it was worth it.  Our table became available, we were seated, and we enjoyed a pre-dinner salad (nothing fancy, but fresh and tasty), and the customary carrots/celery/radish/green onion bowl of veggies.

The fish arrived, and wow.  Wow - that's about all I can say.  So wonderful.  Lightly breaded, fried to perfection, and not a single hint of grease.  Served piping hot, to boot.  What we all liked about the fish was the fact that the fish was actually the star - the breading wasn't overdone and it didn't steal any of the thunder from the fish.  

The hashbrowns were huge and perfectly cooked - dark/crispy brown crust with a perfectly melted cheese blend on top.  Just a hint of grease, but we're picking nits here...

The bill arrived - $44 for the three of us, including another round of drinks.  Our server, Rhonda, was absolutely stellar as well - she took fantastic care of us, and it turns out that her son and his girlfriend were the bartenders.

Summary: Toby's Supper Club = WIN

Food: 4.5 - 4.75 stars
Service: 4.5 stars
Value: 4.5 stars
Atmosphere: 4.5 stars (classic supper club: paneling, dark wood)
Misc: Dinged slightly for the long wait and sauna-like heat

Summary: It's worth the wait to get fish here on Friday nights.  Just dress comfortably, bring some cash for the bar, and be prepared to wait.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I personally love this Taco Bell. It's right outside of my work so can get a quick meal whenever I have a break and just relax in their nice old school dinning room. I may even go a little too often as the counter people are starting to recognize me lol. I was going to give this three stars until I found out they serve breakfast now too! It's doesn't start until 8am for all you extra early people, but Taco Bell didn't open until 10am before this, so it's still an upgrade. Great location too in a nice sizeable shopping center with lots of other food and retail options!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Stopped by this place on a whim whilst in the northwest valley. It was challenging to find in the warehouse location. 

I agree with the other reviewers that the tasting room is very small and needs some re-work. There are 3 high top tables with uncomfortable (no back) stools and a few counters to stand by. I would rather have some smaller 2-tops that could be combined or pulled apart.

Beer was a bit pricey, but not out of the norm for other breweries or pubs. The IPAs have some decent flavor and aren't the hop biting type. There's a nice mellow saison that's great for summer. 

Place doesn't serve any food, but I'm sure they'd be fine with bringing some of your own. 

Patrons were all very nice and friendly. Wait staff and management went out of their way to be helpful and welcoming.

I'll come back when I'm nearby. It should be a planned stop for anyone who likes to support local beer.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Angelo's white pizza is somewhat of a family tradition for me.  I can't say for certain when my clan first trucked out to Monona, but it started a trend that has kept up through the years.  In reality Angelos is a perfectly serviceable Italian-style family restaurant that does pizza and pasta amongst other things, but I couldn't tell you about anything other than the white pizza.  Over the last decade plus I can't remember a single time when I didn't order the same thing.  Normally this would be boring and I'd feel disappointed in myself for such unimaginative thinking, but in the case of Angelo's my nostalgia trumps all.  And it isn't exactly like I'm here every week - I don't make it out to Monona all that often, and I'm lucky if I grace Angelo's with my presence two times in one year.  But when I do, I'm in white pizza heaven.  It's not the be-all, end-all when it comes to pizza, but there's something to the combination of sausage, artichoke hearts, olives and alfredo sauce that is simply amazing.  It's close to my favorite singular meal in the Madison area, and when I think about it I'm tempted to slap down five stars for the pizza alone.  

I made my latest trip to Angelo's a week or so back, and it marked the first time I'd been since they went smoke-free.  It's a definite improvement, to be sure.  I was, however, saddened to see that the dining room had been renovated.  It looks perfectly nice, if a bit generic, but before it had real atmosphere.  The walls had been lined with bottles of chianti, the fiaschi (the bottles with straw baskets - I looked that up) decorated by past diners over the years.  It was tradition to order a bottle of chianti and document the occasion with a message or a sketch.  I was told by the waitress that the bottles had deteriorated beyond repair and had to be taken down.  I'd always hoped that one of those bottles had my writing on it.

As much as I love Angelo's, my last trip was just a bit disappointing in terms of service.  The white pizza was excellent as always, but we were left without drink refills for a bit too long.  Maybe it was because it was at the tail end of the night, but the waitstaff came off a bit brisk and the overall vibe wasn't as enjoyable as before.  But maybe that's just me, maybe it was the newness of the dining room that made the night stick out.  Still, Angelo's without the nostalgia remains a pretty decent place, and the first bite of white pizza reminds me of why I'll always keep coming back.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is a no-frills restaurant that serves a variety of crepes (sweet and savory), one type of waffle, Krispy Kreme donuts, and some drinks. I opted for the waffle because it was $6.99. Their sweet crepes were $8.99, and their savory crepes were $9.99. The crepes were a bit too pricey for me, as well as their Krispy Kreme Donuts ($1.75 per donut). 

The waffle was very plain. I asked for my whipped cream on the side and got a small ice cream scoop of it. She sprinkled some powdered sugar on top. Butter, sugar-free syrup, and utensils were self-serve.

The waffle was decent, but it didn't taste spectacular. If I come back here again, I'll try their crepes.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Great Margaritas.

But it's hard to review a mexican restaurant that's as good as the next.

I still wish there was a TRULY good mexican restaurant in Madison...

Still waiting.

And don't come tell me ... um... the one on Park.. what's that name???

....

La Hacienda.

I'd rather poke my eye out or eat at La Bambas....</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>My partner and I were pointed in the direction of Rick's from a bouncer around the corner at The Opal Lounge (who had politely informed us that we were 2 years late for dinner service there!). We walked in and both thought yeah, just what we are looking for. It had that cosy feel, but with a buzz from music and people having fun (it was a Fri night). We were going to be seated next to the door but asked if we could have something further back and she took us to the conservatory. The smell of mint (from the frehly-made mojito's hit us as we walked through and whet our appetite for a cocktail from the (very) long selection list and both were happy with our choices.


 On to the food, to start I had the butternut squash &amp; ginger soup and my GF had the mussels. Both were very good (and very decent portion sizes). A glass of house red each next with our mains and I don't know if they accidentally gave us red from the wrong bottle, but it was absolutely delicious.


 For mains, I had the rack of lamb with mushroom rosti (both were excellent and the lamb was cooked perfectly, if not slightly fatty). GF had pan-friend sea bass on a bed of scallop/king prawn risotto and we both agreed that this was one of the best risottos we'd ever had.


 After these considerable portions, there was no space for desert. We were also delighted to find out that our mains were BOGOF and the total bill came to a reasonable £50 (+ tips). Staff were friendly.
A nice experience.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>One of the most amazing liquor stores on the face of the planet.  It is a total dive that happens to carry only the best in the world of beer, wine and spirits. Don't know what you want to drink? Just talk to one of the friendly workers and within minutes they will be suggesting a libation that will perfectly suit your mood and palate.  I wish that all businesses could operate in the way this one does and really cater to the needs of the customer.
Why only 4 stars then? Well, I'd like to give it 4.5 if that were possible. I subtract that half star because ya know what? Sometimes I like to drink like a hobo, and they just aren't carrying the cheap swill that I occasionally desire.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Considering the amount of occasions I've passed every different branch of Howies in Edinburgh, it's pretty incredible that I only just visited one for dinner very recently. The Alva Street branch of Howies is tucked away downstairs in a basement in the west end, so I got a bit lost looking for it, even with an iPhone equipped with GPRS and a supposedly extensive knowledge of Edinburgh geography.

The restaurant's interior is simple, but attractive and modern, and you do feel very instantly comfortable and relaxed. Howies is a great option if you fancy a meal out with friends, but nothing too fancy or formal, and advantages are that you can bring your own vino, plus the bill is never going to come to anything too outrageous, because the menu prices are fairly inexpensive. My fish main course was absolutely fine, not bad in any way, and decent enough, but it could have done with a wee extra something to give it that additional bit of tastiness. Definitely an option to consider for casual or otherwise city centre dining.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Amazing sandwiches! Glad they are in the neighborhood! Gotta do Dutch crunch and dirty sauce. I had the Elvis Keith added jalapeño, super good. Onion rings are really tasty but not that big of an order for sharing. So come eat here!  Very friendly guy at the counter from the San Francisco location.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We were invited for a preview brunch last Saturday. They did a really nice job with the space, even though it was smaller than the other locations. Our server was fantastic; super friendly and attentive. I got the chilaquiles, which was delicious. I also got a Bloody Mary, which I asked for spicy, and they delivered! Overall I was really impressed and I'm very happy to have a Vig in my neighborhood!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Adorable place and delicious flavors.  Some are really crazy - watermelon and jalapeño. I was told that everything is made fresh on site. Prices are good. The staff is really well dressed, outdoor ambiance is relaxing and with easy access to Monte Carlo casino and resort. If you're on the strip for a walk, between shows, or staying at Monte Carlo, this is a super easy place for a nice break. Good thing the line moves quick!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>New dumpling resturant, not sure if anyone else can recommend other dumpling resturants but this is very delicious. 

I brought my friends from LA here and they enjoyed it too!

The decorations are red and flowers as seen in pictures. They have private rooms: party size and large.

Must order: lamb dumplings!! You can't go wrong with it!

Parking is a bit limited but there is some in the back.

Local mom and pop resturant! I support local restaurants!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Great food, even better service! One of my pet peeves getting old fries with my food, they dropped fries fresh just for my order.  Also I dropped my drink and spilled it all over, the kid smiled and said "no problems, that's what a mop is for." I was happly surprised with their great attitudes.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Went to try Sunny World as it was close to home, mistake #1, girl/waitress taking our order to go had difficulty with english and had to go to the kitchen numerous times to see what was in a dish, mistake #2' order came out and manager tried to make lame jokes ( that I can deal with). Took the order home and upon opening the Kung Pao combo (beef,chicken &amp; shrimp), I found a slimy mess of lettuce, vegetables(I think) and NO meat whatsoever ! The order of cashew chicken had a small amount of what may have been chicken but was void of any flavor and was greasy. When I called the establishment to complain about the slop that was served and that it was nothing close to what was ordered, the girl that answered the phone said "sorry", nothing else, no attempt to correct the matter, transfer to the joke making manager or any other resolution, mistake #3. This is an establishment that should be avoided at all costs, if most restaurants fail in the first year it is because of situations like this, poor customer service, lack of remorse for substandard food etc. I only wish I could give a lower star than one.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Grabbed a slice because there was a huge line for the buffet and we were trying to make a movie. This was quick - though it take her nearly 10 minutes to serve us the rewarmed pizza. Which, by the way, was so molten that it literally MELTED the plate she served it on. When I told her that it couldn't be healthy to eat something that just melted its way through styrofoam, she just gave me a blank stare.

That's OK, because - healthily laden with styrofoam shell or not - this pizza was dry, bland, and altogether nasty. Wash there even cheese on it? Not sure. Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore). How is it possible to make sausage flavorless? Dunno, but they managed.

On the way out, there was a line of 4-6 people deciding which tasty slice they'd order. As flashed my mutilated plate on my way to the garbage can, I whispered to the one in front, "Save yourself - it's absolutely terrible," and she got the rest of the line to leave with her. Victory.

Yech. Should have gone hungry. Just terrible.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The quality is what you'd come to expect from chatime. I'm happy to see one in waterloo. There is usually a long wait here but that's because its not your average bubble tea place.

I know it's tempting to have tapioca and a bunch of fruity flavors in your "bubble tea". But remember that you have come to the Starbucks of bubble tea shops. Try something new and unique. I highly recommend the Grassjelly Roasted Milk Tea. (less sugar no ice)</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I'm a huge fan of paradise bakery, but this was my first experience at panera. Terrible. Service is slow, staff is obviously undertrained, the restaurant is unorganized and doesn't flow, the food was mediocre, my fork was dirty (and you have to ask the staff for another one, as they do not place them out for customers), and the espresso machine was down. I won't be going back, at least to this location.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I dunno about the food here as I have not attended during normal business hours. Rather, I broke in and robbed the place as a thief in the night. You guys probably saw it on the news. Kidding...well, lying actually.

Instead last year during a business trip to the valley my cousin managed to drag me to this place (he and his boys love this place) one saturday night. I flashed my Texas dl, slipped the doorlady her $20, and was mighty surprised to walk inside and hear the DJ playing some of the hottest R&amp;B and Hip-Hop jams known to man.

OT's on a saturday night is not swanky and posh as many of the spots in say Scottsdale are, so do not expect anything over the top. Rather expect a multicultural urban crowd of twentysomethings simply mingling and grooving to Musiq, Dwele, Kanye West, a good remix here and there, etc.

Nothing incredible on paper, but the music was pretty damn good.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Been here a few times for lunch as I work right next door in Costco. Decent food, nothing to rave about, usually have a good lunch special each day. They did just remodel the interior while being closed about two weeks. Inside is very nice now, more inviting and modern. It was really starting to look dated so the refreshed look is great. The manager is fantastic as well, always asking if you need anything, just making sure you're taken care of. Some days I just don't feel like coming here and I'm not quite sure why, but when I have gone in it's been okay. Nice to have that other option so close just in case nothing else sounds appealing that day.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>When I first set foot in here, the only aroma I could smell was the stench of economic deprivation. This is not an upmarket venue, nor is it for those who look for aesthetic charm in their eateries. The harsh lighting will highlight just how hideous your facial features are, and the way in which the windows expose you to passers by on the busy street outside, ensures that they all know you're a disgusting, greedy pig.

But there's more to Aroma than first meets the eye, and like many of the somewhat scruffy looking food joints down this street, it's a lot better than it looks. 

Having only made one visit, where I purchased the aforementioned falafel, I can state that, in some ways, I prefer the more heart attack inducing version of mediterranean cooking at Aroma to the real thing. I'd rather eat it takeaway next time though, this is an exceptionally grim cafe to sit in.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Beautiful decor, beautiful cocktails, great service.  You are going to pay quite a penny for a cocktail but what a great contribution to the cocktail scene on the strip.  Average drink is $16 but when you watch all the steps and care going into each cocktail you see why.  

I tried two cocktails, one was called the Tennessee squirrel which was whiskey based and came with a nice cup filled with almonds on top.  The second one was a punch.  Both were very pretty, flavorful and strong.  You aren't going to go sit at this bar and drink all day, but what a way to start a night on the strip!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Subway is like that slapper friend of yours that you love to death, but don't like to admit to anyone that you're actually friends with. 

"Where did you go last night?"
*cough* *cough* "suwy".
"Eh? Where?"
"Hey, look, someone dropped a fiver".

Subway is dark, cheap, and you will leave with loads of drink spilled all over you. Damn this place is fun.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I have been here a few times and still not impressed. Last night was my breaking point. I ordered a hamburger medium rare and it came out well. I sent it back and the second burger came out even more done...almost on the crispy side. I think the cook took offense that I sent it back. No manager or owner at the restaurant? Nothing was said or done to make it right. There doesn't seem to be anyone in charge of the place. Is there an owner? do they care how their place is run? I like the location and the servers seem friendly. I like that there a lot of TVs to watch a game</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is a quality seafood restaurant housed in what for decades was an oyster/shellfish market. I know what you are thinking....seafood, in WISCONSIN?? But let me tell you - all their fish is fresh, and come on folks, even in the Bay Area, if you eat seafood, most of it was frozen at one point, and much of it is shipped from somewhere else. Don't think just because some of you live near the Pacific Ocean means everything comes in fresh. Look for specials and variations in the menu from what is online. Raw oysters are really nice, and look for their red curry crab soup, reminiscent of good Thai food. Be advised though - although the prices are reasonable, the portions are not "American style", meaning filling every inch of plate. Still, I wouldn't let this deter you from eating here. What it may lack in quantity, it definitely makes up for in quality. If you want seafood, this is the place.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The sandwiches here are simple - bun, coleslaw or sauerkraut, cheese, and meat.  Almost too much meat; I got the meat sweats.  BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich was delicious, and I had to eat it with a fork 'cause there was so much pork (good BBQ sauce, nice and tender pork).  The Straw (pastrami) sandwich looked amazing as well.  Next time I think I'll go for a half sandwich, half salad or something.  Oh, they also do potato pancakes, which is pretty neat (although they looked pretty thick).  The sandwich and a fountain drink cost me about $9.50, so it's not that cheap.  Sticklers is cheaper, Duck &amp; Decanter has more choices and seemed healthier, but if you want a heap of tasty meat with your sandwich, this is the place.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I can't recommend these guys enough. When I first signed up I was skeptical that I would hear back from them, but just as their website says, Danielle texted me to set up our night. Once you confirm that you are interested in going to the club (we went to Light) the limo driver Colin texts you for you to give him your time and place of pickup. He picked us up at EXACTLY the time he said he was going to at the Excalibur, the exact minute. Tip Colin well, he's great. Colin dropped us off at Light and we were immediately introduced to Nick who walked us straight to the front of the line at Light. There was a long line but we were walked right up to the front and right in.

The next night we were offered either Surrender or Drai's, and my group chose Surrender. Colin picked us up at the EXACT minute again, except this time at the Cosmo, and dropped us off out front where we met Nick again. At Surrender, all of the girls in my group were given wrist bands for free drinks.

I can't recommend their service enough. If you are planning a Vegas trip and want to enjoy the night life, you're doing yourself a disservice if you don't at least try to use their service.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I'm a falafel fiend, so finding out that a new Mediterranean joint has popped up on State made me do a happy dance. Okay, I had a happy one-person rave. 

I stopped by on a rainy Monday night and grabbed the falafel plate for a slick $5. The service was a tad slow, but I think they're still working out the kinks since they just opened supah recently. The falafel was just how it should be: crispy golden goodness on the outside, flavorful and soft on the inside. I'll be back!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I enjoy this place so much it gives me happy feet!
I was looking for a burger place that wasn't fast food near my house one day &amp; stumbled upon this tasty establishment. I walked in to see a very clean &amp; very inviting dining room. They have a wide range of foods from hamburgers, wings, fried zuchini, cheese fries, &amp; so much more. They just recently added steakburgers which I can't wait to try. The bacon cheeseburger is so good it makes my stomach smile. Maybe I'm crushing so hard on this place because I just ate there tonight but do yourself a favor &amp; eat here if your around 91st ave &amp; Thomas. Enjoy!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The food is amazing and the staff is soooo nice! Really cool for fun family nights out. They also have a night life because of their bar - They have karaoke nights (sat. 9pm-12am) and tequila tasting nights, really fun! My favorite dish there is their HOMEMADE Cavatelli with Vodka Sauce - to die for! The first time I tried it, they were catering at an event I was at, now I order it all the time! YUM!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Case# 25       Food of my childhood

I have been eating these subs since I was a little kid. My mom (R.I.P) used bring me here and it is one of the few childhood memories I hang on to. For those who do not know about this place as the food detective I will share a little background info from my case files to help you out. 

Mr. Submarine is actually a small chain that really got it's start here in the valley in the early 80's. At one time the locations stretched from the east valley to west phoenix. With increased competition from larger sub chains ( Subway, Cousins, Blimpy, and Quiznos they were forced to limit their growth and use word of mouth advertising to keep customers coming in. This resulted in store closings and now only two locations remain open. When you try and compare a place like this to say a subway which spends big time money to advertise their five dollar foot long special, or their new breakfast sandwich there is no competition. 

This place wins by a mile. Who needs a 5 dollar foot long that is served by some teenager who only cares about his shift ending so he can escape. No, I would rather have the owner there serving me a sandwich that he himself is going to eat for lunch. Don't give me slimy meat and dried out looking cheese. I want soft fresh bread with toppings that enhance the other components of my sandwich not cover it up! OK enough with the ranting, this place is a no frills type of place. No wraps or cookies. They offer the normal meat choices including ham, turkey, tuna and your choice of bread ( white, wheat, and sourdough).

No annoying jingles or sandwich Nazis (read my subway review), just good food, made and served by someone who cares about what they are selling you.  They are open Monday through Friday 10am to 10pm and Saturday and Sunday from 10am to 8pm.

They are a little more pricey than Subway but for a great sandwich and great service it is well worth the price.

Case closed</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Ate there today for lunch.  Service was very good, food was excellent.   Had a stromboli and it was delicious.   My daughter had a slice of pepperoni pizza and it was also very good.

Very nice addition to the neighborhood.  Will be back soon.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>It's mouse-wee and, with bare wood everywhere and a Wes Anderson coffee-table book there for the browsing, well, you could say it was hipster as hell. But who cares? Is that actually a perjorative term anyway? They are a coffee shop, and so they have coffee, good coffee, although despite my recent CoffeeEpiphany, I am very glad that I chose the hot chocolate, because... kids, let me tell you about that hot chocolate.

It was a marshmallow in a cup.

Now, you know and I know and the whole world knows that hot chocolate ain't worth squat if it doesn't come with marshmallow goodness, but what the world was waiting for Fortitude to show it is that putting the marshmallow on top is DOING IT WRONG. I know this now. I have seen the light.

It was a marshmallow... In. A. Cup.

The hot chocolate came in a little jug beside it. And as I poured that creamy yum into the cup, the marshmallow began to gooify and disintegrate, becoming one with the liquid, until only part of its mass bobbed around on the surface. And the hot chocolate was rich, and viscose, and sweet, and... revelatory.

Now then, it wasn't a big cup, and it did cost me £3. Likewise, a very slim sliver of lemon drizzle cake, dense and moist though it was, set me back £2.60. In all honesty, this is more of a 3.5 star review, because mighty fine though those things were I didn't feel they entirely justified the price... but heck, I'll go back for another, and a blueberry bundt while I'm at it, and if that doesn't qualify for a spot of enthusiasm in the starring then what does?</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Based on my first trip, Beijing Express is very good.  Mongolian beef and General Tso's chicken and dumplings were all better than the same offerings by other Chinese in the area.  They gave me a lunch special price on a Sunday at 3:03pm, which was very appreciated.  The portion sizes are substantial, the vegetables in the Mongolian beef were fresh and plentiful.  The location is clean, and they deliver which is awesome.  It's nothing ground breaking, but it is now my go-to Chinese place.  Keep up the good work!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I came here for a company dinner and had a really lovely time. I ordered the lobster tail and it came with rice and green beans. I thought everything was really good. I did have two co-workers of mine order the surf and turf with the steak cooked medium rare. They both said it was a little on the "leathery" side. The service was fantastic! Other than that, my only other complaint was that it was really warm inside. However, i'd recommend this restaurant :)</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The only reason this place got three stars is because the food is amazing, BUT the service is terrible. The people they have working there have absolutely zero social skills and a severe listening problem. I'm ordering a sandwich, I don't need to give you a personal history and take a freaking survey to order my food. Listen to what I tell you I want and give me what I ask for. It's not a Wolfgang Puck 5 star restaurant.  I don't need you to go into the services you provide. I want a sandwich.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This used to be Al's Chicago Style Hot Dogs.  We went in expecting that it would just be similar food and service with a different name.  Boy, were we wrong.  The service is really, really slow.  It took 20 minutes to get 3 hot dogs and a gyro with only 2 other customers in the place.  The other customers were pretty upset about how slow it was and actually said something and ended up with free cheesecake.  We didn't say anything and weren't even offered an apology for the slowness even though they knew they were slow.  The whole vibe that Al's had and the quality of food, service, etc. has been lost and we won't be back.  It's sad too, because we started going to Al's a couple weeks after it opened several years ago.  Definitely going to miss it.  If you want Chicago style food, this isn't going to be the best place in town, but if you're close, it's convenient.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Very nice place.. if you are a pastries fan then i would definitely recommend this place. Lots of variety of pastries and chaat snacks. I have tried pav bhaji , samosa chaat and chicken tikka pizza, samosas(both big and Irani) and puffs. Everything was good only concern was samosa could have been better.The service is kind off slow and we have to request for water all the time.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Old-timey fern bar with a fish fry like you used to enjoy with Grandma.  Like the other reviewers, I order the ocean perch which comes family style with crinkle-cut fries!    This place is so good I make the destination of my twice-yearly meat craving!  (That's right - I consider fish meat.)  Don't sweat the wait you are likely to encounter (even if you and Gram get there at 4:30).  The bartenders make a delightful spicy Bloody Mary, which helps add to the overall feeling that have I reached retirement age.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>My new theory is that McDonald's is developing animatronic workers to replace humans but hasn't gotten the artificial intelligence module to work right.

The single star is not for serving McDonald's food, as if you're considering eating here, you've already signed on for that, know what to expect, and are mostly interested in the fries anyway.

The single star is because Waiting for Godot makes logical forward progress faster than the staff here. Any deviation from the program baffles them.

For instance, the corporate overlords added a value menu item to compete directly with Burger King's bacon double cheeseburger. Hint: when a customer orders it with the BK name, this is a GOOD thing. It means the strategy is working. Do not go all blue-screen-of-death until the customer comes up with the exact Mickey Dee's trademarked name. Then, when asked what's on it, don't require multiple reboots to deal with the question.

Most important, when you realize you have put a to-go order on a tray instead of in a bag, PUT IT IN A BAG and deliver it to the customer. Do not decide this is too complex to cope with and leave it sit back in the food prep area until the customer gets tired of waiting and asks about it. When asked, do not go all eye-rolling. It is your JOB to deliver people's orders correctly and in a timely manner. You screwed up. Say "I'm so sorry" (yes, we both know you have no emotion module, but fake it) and fix it.

Additionally, do not fill the unsweet tea dispenser with sweet tea. I like McDonald's sweet tea, but I like it when I have poured myself sweet tea, not when I deliberately avoided it because there'd be plenty of sugar in my (now lukewarm) pie.

The new restaurant design is impressive, in the manner of late 1990s federal courthouses, and this one has a McCafé. However, it's possible that it's all some sort of perverse performance art or social experiment, as this location is not listed on McDonald's official site.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place is like a step back ino the 80s. It is how I remembered A&amp;W when I was a little guy. This place has the best root beer floats and freezes, but the food is like your average bowling alley... Always greesy but  has that familiar delicious taste. Overall a classy establishment, but old school (which gives it it's charm).</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>OMG I love their cookies. My friend introduced me to them a few years back and I've been a fan ever since. When I found out they opened one in Mainland US, I was so excited. Even MORE excited that it was perfect timing with my trip to Vegas a few weeks after.

The place was kind of hard to find if you don't know which part of the Grand Canal Shopps it's located.  It's located across from I Love Burgers on the Palazzo side.

they have samplers near the front door of all their flavors. And the staff was friendly and would tell you which boxes would give you a better value.  They're good at upselling here. haha

In any case, they also have a stamper card. You get a stamp for every $5. And if you hit 10 stamps, you can get a small bag of their cookies valued at $6. If not, save up to 20 stamps to get their $15 sampler box free.

I love these cookies.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>first i want to say, i have not been to Lao Ching Hing in a long while. and for reasons that will be outlined below.

i have been going to Lao Ching Hing for probably 9 years if not more.

the first time there we were waited on by a gentlemen straight of of a old kung-fu movie, long pinky nail, long pony tail. amazing service. the next year or so every time we visited, 1-2 times a week. always great service. remembered the drinks we ordered, awesome. after a year or so, first change up we noticed. faces looked different. the pepper steak got a recipe change, not to our liking either. oh well right. find something else on the menu. lots of great options. tangerine beef, orange chicken, Gen. Tcho, dragon &amp; phoenix, sizzling rice soup, endless list of yummy things. service is on par with before. the waiter always remembered us, in fact always had our drinks on the table before we entered. at this point in the review you should know we go there allot OK. it's the shit...and we tip well. they love us. right?...
well i guess at this point 6-7 years go by and it's 2007 we haven't been there in awhile because..well we moved to another part of phoenix and the local restaurants were good. anyways. so we go to Lao to see how things are... well sadly it was not the same. all of a sudden Coca-Cola bought the place or something. advertising on the plastic cups??? never was like that before. seemed like new owner took over and turned it into a comical version of what i remember. didn't seem authentic anymore. and the last straw. recipe changes. i didn't like what i ordered. it was just different and i didn't like it. never returned. :(

now at this point your thinking. where the hell is the review. well lets face it...this is not a review. it's an obituary to my favorite restaurant. RIP Lao Ching Hing.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Last weekend while my sister and brother-in-law were in town from Chicago, we made a visit to Bonnie Springs for the day. While there, we enjoyed all there is to do but were treated to our very first taste of Las Vegas Kettle Corn. 

My sister and I are Kettle Corn lovers, as we HAVE to pick up a bag whenever and wherever we see some. When we first approached the small table they had set up, they immediately asked if we wanted to sample their kettle corn. We jumped at their offer and the man behind the table asked us to hold out our hands. With our hands cupped together, the man generously poured a heaping scoop of kettle corn into our hands-- so heaping, I had to eat out of my hands to allow one hand to eventually be freed from sweet 'n salty goodness. We purchased one large bag of kettle corn and one large bag of the three layer cheddar, kettle corn, and caramel mix. It wasn't long before we had eaten through half of an entire bag. When we returned home, my sister and I ate through the top two layers of the mix before I had to tell my sister to physically take the back away from me. Yes, it was THAT good.

After finishing both bags and establishing a kettle corn addiction, I was beginning to feel withdrawals as the week went on. So today, I made the journey across town (roughly 30 minutes) to buy two more bags. 

I arrived at Las Vegas Kettle Corn to be immediately greeted with a smile by the sole employee working there at the time, Deborah. She was sooooo sweet! She offered me samples of whatever they had, although I held back and only took two. I was in there for a while just talking with her and left with one large back of kettle corn and one large bag of kettlemel (kettle corn &amp; caramel mix). DEEEEEELISH!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This KFC never has the chicken you want ready.  The staff and customers are awful.  The dining room is often hazy with smoke flowing out of the kitchen.  I go here only because it's close to work and sometimes I really want a side or sandwich which they usually have.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Was it the best ever? Maybe not but we were hungry and everything was extremely hot and fresh. I could barely finish my burger. It was also nice to eat outside near the fountain at night and bring our dog out. So will definitely be back. Not too often though. It is fast food! They lost one star for service mainly because of lack of English knowledge by counter person. Not friendly either.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Vastly underrated Thai. I always like to try other Thai restaurants to see if I'm missing out on anything but always gravitate back to Sing Thai. It is a small restaurant tucked away in Stockbridge and has an intimate atmosphere. Food is always fresh and dishes that claim to be spicy genuinely are. Lucky, the owner, is a great guy and always has time to chat, even when the restaurant is packed. Beef Yum salad is the best in town.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>So my friends LOVE this place, but I was pretty much less than impressed with it.  I know it's recently opened, the original is in Chicago. 

We sat at the bar and I guess it was the bartender's first day (she made a comment about it), and I kinda felt like people were riding her pretty hard, which I didn't understand cause she seemed to be a pretty competent bartender.

The non-wine happy hour prices are good.  The wine is $5 a glass for the happy hour price (down from their $7-8 glass), which would be ok if the wine were better, but it was just ok.  I have to say they do give you a really generous pour, I received a full wine glass full of prosecco for my $5.  

The food is where they lost me.  I ordered the Jimmy's style bruschetta - it was a pile of tomatoes, kalamata olives, artichoke hearts and mozzarella DROWNED in olive oil, surrounded by bread that wasn't toasted and also coated in olive oil.  The whole thing was way to oily, it would have been better if the bread was toasted, it would have been less squishy.   

I also ordered the small antipasto salad.  I was amazed by this salad, it was a mountain with at least a thousand calories of mozzarella and salami... I am usually a HUGE fan of both, but there literally was so much I scooped up a bunch of it and donated it to J's salad before just putting the superfluous stuff on an extra plate.  The other problem was the fact that this salad was SWIMMING in red wine vinegar and olive oil.  It was way too much, it took 4 napkins to soak up the excess dressing.  The pizza tasted like a generic deep dish from any major chain.

I'm sure this place will pull itself together.  It's a cute place, and the owners seem pretty nice, but there are a few kinks that need to be straightened out... my advice - ask for less olive oil.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Usually when I visit my family in Phoenix it takes what seems like a lifetime to find a place to eat that is not the tried, true, and tired.  Eating at this modest restaurant was the culinary highlight of my trip to Phoenix.  I implore all Phoenicians to frequent this establishment and your taste buds will thank you.

For starters, the chips were wonderfully light and not too oily.  The chips come with two different types of salsa.  A red salsa with a little bit of a bite and a green avocado salsa that is mild with just the right hint of avocado. 

I ordered the shrimp in garlic sauce and the dish was sublime.  The shrimp were sauteed with red bell peppers and onions.  The vegetables were cooked perfectly - not too soft and not too crunchy.  The garlic sauce was wonderfully sweet and garlicky.  I couldn't get enough of it.

My dining companions both ordered the Camarones Culichi.  This dish is freaking amazing!  It consists of shrimp cooked in a green tomatillo sauce and loaded with melted Manchego cheese.  The sauce is divine and words cannot describe it properly.  

The perfect accompaniments to these dishes were Mexican Coca-Colas (Yay!), creamy beans topped with cheese, and white rice with vegetables.  The tortillas were right on and looked to be homemade.

Leave behind the comfort of the fancy pants restaurants that the trendinistas like to go to and try something real.  You will not be sorry.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I love Chinese dumplings!  Especially if the succulent wrappers used to encase the dumpling fillings are hand made and the dumplings are assemble and cook to order. It is a major comfort food category for me. In fact ?? boiled dumplings is the first item I have ever personally ordered on my own with lunch money my mom gave me for elementary school in Taipei. It was just a few pennies each and the shop made it and delivered it in a plastic bag to my school with my name on it just in time for lunch break.  I don't remember much about how it tasted, but the memory of having tremendous emotional satisfaction and joy from that simple meal is still very strong.

So while driving to try out a new ramen place a few miles down the street, the light from this new restaurant caught my eye, and I decided to make a quick,but very safe u-turn into the small parking lot in front of Dumpling King.  There are plenty of spaces in the back of the building, in case this restaurant gets super popular in the coming weeks. I was initially afraid that I was dropping in as the restaurant was about to close, since it was fairly empty inside, but looking at their hours of operation, I was relieved to see that I had 1.25 hours left.

I made a quick scan of the restaurant, and pretty much was blinded by all the red color in the restaurant.  Red floral printed seat covers over each chair.  The tablecloth were reddish in color, and the lighting was fairly dim, so yeah I was slightly disoriented from the color red.  I wonder if that is a normal reaction or it is just one of those minor details that made me just a little different from the other 6 odd billion people on this planet (not including the aliens that left zigzag lights over the skies of Hawaii).

Anyway, after picking a nearby table with good lighting for taking food pictures and going over the menu, I eventually found the "dumpling" section all the way on the last page under "Main Food" and ordered the following:

101. Beef Steamed Dumplings(4) ???? - Decent flavor, but I felt the texture of the filling was off. Like it was overground or overworked.

102. Beef Dumplings(4) ???? - Same filling as the above, except this dumpling is boiled.

103. Lamb Dumplings(4) ???? - Good dumpling, nice lamb flavor. Dumpling is also boiled and looks exactly like the Beef Dumpling.

112. Stone Dumplings ???? - This is like a big plate full of pot stickers that is cooked in a pan, and inverted onto the plate. The residual starchy water forms a thin crust that connects all of the dumplings together (see the picture).  It is kind of cool looking, but eat these fast.  Because I was taking time to take pictures, and all the food came more or less at the same time, I noticed that a small pool of oil puddle up on the plate after like 10 minutes, which made it taste not as good as the very first piece I had.  Just something to think about if you are dining solo or eat very slowly.

NOTE: Although their menu have prices listed for dumplings with portions of (4), I was told that it was a misprint and now the minimum order is (8) dumplings, so you now need to order those items x2.  But for the Beef and Lamb Dumplings that comes out to (8 pieces) for $5, not too bad price wise, but does present an additional hurdle against trying as much of the menu as possible without asking for the doggie bag.  They did however let me order four pieces of each of the Beef Dumplings and Lamb Dumplings, for a total of eight pieces, since both are cooked the same way.

Overall, I thought the food was A-OK at this family operated restaurant (Mom, and son both works here in the front, and the dad is likely in the kitchen cooking).  It is the closest Chinese dumpling restaurant to where I live for now, so I will be stopping by in the near future.  Plus I asked to see if they also can make Xiao Long Bao, given that they are calling themselves the Dumpling King and serve many of the dumpling specialties from the same region, and was told that they just added that to their menu that day.  Would have been nice to offer up such information when I was reading the menu or at the time I was placing my orders, but oh well. Just another reason to go back. Maybe later for dinner.

Credit cards are accepted here, but when I gave them my AmEx card (there is a AmEx sticker along with the usual suspects on the front door) but was asked to pay with a different card (because American Express charges a higher fee - perhaps, but more likely due to AmEx not distributing the funds to their merchant clients for an entire billing cycle). Yeah, pretty much all the small vendors are hating on AmEx, and to think (if you are old enough) that they once dominated the credit card market. Oh how the mighty has fallen indeed.  

3.5 stars.  I am sure another update will be forth coming should I get to try the XLB on my next visit.

    <review:review_text>We've been customers for years, and this is a great place to go for wine. The owners not only know their stock, once they get to know you they always have a recommendation for you. It's also a cigar bar with an extensive selection. 

I've found some lovely wines here. When I want an absolutely excellent bottle of wine for a special occasion, this is the place I go.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Most people know all about Jamba Juice...this is just a review for the average joe who doesn't usually spend 5 bucks on one beverage.

This location is a hop and a skip away from the office...yet I've only gone here twice.  Reason is the price.  You can't get out of there spending less than $4 on one drink.  That's not my idea of pocket friendly...but, you are getting a really good beverage.

They have all kinds of smoothies and shakes and juices and such.  If its wet, they got it.  Well, not really. But you get my point.  You will definitely find something you like here...and if not, then just create it!

This particular location has great service...at least the three times I've been there (just went during this review!).

All in all, its a treat to be had maybe once or twice a week for us regular folks...if you're a big timer then maybe you go everyday?  Its good good good stuff, that's for sure.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Although I've never had a bad experience here or felt like I was walking into a rooting-interest goocher (I'm something like 5-0 here as a spectator), I cannot really recommend this as a destination spot for game watching.  I really have a problem with the dynamics of the TV arrangements, and although they all appear to be plasma (not LCD), someone here lacks the capability or willingness to change a number of their broadcasts to HD until well into 'the game' or never at all.

The table positioning is awkward at best.  They force you into a 45 degree angle, where, if you have 4-5 people in the group, 3 are forced at painful angles for sustained TV viewing.  And before Dbacks games, this place looks like the Texas polygamist ranch, with all the kids and their daddies in here.  Its too much.

Their semi-shaded patio and brick-warehouse structure is gorgeous tho.  If you can snag a spot out front, the atmosphere feels pretty enthusiastic and wholly uplifting, truth be told.  Almost like a real sports/entertainment district.

Food is awful, but really who cares?  You're here for the beer and they have that.  It just might not be the place you'd wanna be unless you fancy a quick round or two before a Dbacks or Suns game.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Busse's is very much a typical neighborhood tavern, with cheap drinks (cheapest in the city that I've found) and nice down to earth people.  Recent updates have been made as far as tv's, games, sound system, etc., so if you haven't been in a while to catch a game or hear some music (the old juke box was circa 1970's) you might give it another shot.  

If you are into "bomb" shots the Chuck Norris shot is something you need to try.  If you like tap beer the selection is limited, but very inexpensive, and the lines are always clean (hint: the owner drinks tap beer).  Cocktails are stiff, and REALLY inexpensive.  

If you're a northsider looking for a new local hangout, or someone heading to a Mallard's game looking for a spot near Warner to hit up before or after the game (they always have Mallard gameday specials) this is the place.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I eat here for my birthday every year.  Love the nepalese food, especially the jasmine rice.  You really can't miss, I've never heard any complaints about any of the food.  About $18-22 for an entree, and worth every penny.  Much better than its sister restaurant Himil Chuli.  Nice atmosphere and window seating.  A State Street can't miss....5 stars.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Decided to check out the new spot for us locals of buckeye and was very impressed w the live band, I love live music, sat at the bar, our favorite spot but it took over 10 min for a bartender to greet us much less ask us for our order, then we were asked if we would like a menu, yes, and they never came back to ask if we wanted to order - an hour later. So we took our tab paid and left to the next spot. Please work on your customer service much attention is needed. HAPPY VALENTINES DAY</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We have been here several 3 times in the last few weeks and each time the food was excellent!  We've tried something different each time and have been delighted at how tasty each item has been.  Great salad made with Kale instead of just plain lettuce for a healthier option, HUGE chicken wings fried to perfection, the Turkeygiving Burger that gives the Bobbie a run for it's money and the Chicken N Waffles..oh la la....Absolutely Delish! We will be back again very soon!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This happens occasionally, too. Heidi E. and I are friends, but sometimes friends don't agree. Maybe it's a matter of different tastes, or even different experiences, who knows, but I have a very different take on Med House.

I've been eating at Mediterranean House regularly for the last 6 or 7 years. Started with a group of business friends for occasional lunches, then for dinners with my partner, and now it's a couple times a month for take out. (Have to say I prefer take-out for a few reasons: convenient, neighborhood spot; food travels well; only beer + wine when dining in.)

I find the food here to generally be great - though not always consistent, have had one or two just so-so dinners. That said, when the kitchen is on, the food can be spectacular. We usually order the same few dishes - one of the chicken plates and the gyros platter. 

My favorite chicken plate is the Olympic Chicken, which is grilled chicken breast with a really delicious black olive sauce. The Moroccan Chicken is also really good, and maybe a little healthier with it's herbed breasts, honey-yogurt sauce and side of carrots, apple and spinach (which is not cooked, just shredded, but surprisingly good.) If you want rich flavor, go for the Egyptian Chicken, which is pan-fried in parmesan cheese and herbs. If you want spicy, go for the Chicken Shushka, which is more stew-like, flavored with lots of paprika. 

The Gyros platter is a standard favorite, though Med House does it a little different. No shredded lamb here - instead, you get 4 long pieces of juicy, tender meat. I think the quality is better this way, and it makes for a nice dinner presentation. Pita and house-made yogurt-cucumber sauce are still the perfect accompaniments, and If you like spicy, ask for the spicy green sauce - some kind of minced hot green peppers - the flavors match the gyros meat perfectly.

Hummus and Baba Ganouj appetizers are just OK, I suggest the Lentil soup instead - vegetarian, made from scratch, delicious and hearty. Salad is OK as well - dressing can be a little too citrus-y or vinegar-y for my taste, but always fresh feta and crisp veggies. Love the rice pilaf, with almonds and apricots, and the 2 pasta sides - fettucine with creamed spinach or angel hair pasta with sundried tomato and feta - both are rich with flavor.

If you're interested in trying Mediterranean House, I suggest sooner rather than later, as the strip mall where they're located may be seeing some major changes. The building owner has told tenants he'll not be guaranteeing any leases, and most tenants are already gone. Unfortunately, if Med House loses their lease, they may not reopen at all. I'm pretty sad about that, and a couple nights a month I'm sure my stomach and taste buds will be, too.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Stopped by for lunch.  Small bar food menu, but very good.  Had the Philly Steak Sandwich and an iced tea and hit the spot.  I love patronizing downtown businesses when I get the chance since I don't work too far away from there.  Have friends coming in next week staying at El Cortez so we'll probably have to hit this place in the evening when things are a little livelier.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>After reading with awe and wonderment of the glowing review of the fried cheese curds at OSS Madison on chzcurds.com, I loaded my daughter into the family trickster and sped off to this new Regent Street eatery located next to the venerable Greenbush Bar.

After playing a real life version of Frogger that occurs when attempting to cross Regent Street during rush hour, we pushed our way through the side entrance.  What we saw was a feast for the eyes; the new owners converted the old Careersmith office into Steampunk central, replete with copper tubing, glass columns of bubbling water and gears and gauges galore.  The menu offers a variety of tubular meats including standards like bratwurst and Chicago-style hot dogs.  There's no need to leave your vegetarian friends behind since OSS offers several vegan sausage options.

In addition to the old school options, there are a set of signature dogs, like the Drunky Duck with maple bourbon duck sausage topped with caramelized onions, fresh cranberry sauce, and stone-ground mustard or the Egg Roll, a Chinese pork sausage, topped with sautéed cabbage and carrots, fried wonton strips, spicy mustard, and sweet and sour mayo.

I ended up selecting this month's open source sausage ($6), designed by chef Wave Kasparzak of the acclaimed Dining Room restaurant in Monticello.  It featured a habanero spiced pork sausage, topped with a roasted poblano sour cream, crispy tortilla strips, and fresh cilantro.  While I liked the flavor combinations, the dish was unfortunately sabotaged by a very dry, bland bun (think the Aldi budget hot dog buns 12 for $1).  When I mentioned this to one of the co-owners, he admitted others have shared the same concern and that he was looking new bun alternatives.  I really hope he succeeds in his quest.

As for the cheese curds ($4), both my daughter and I were so impressed we ordered a second helping.  Lightly breaded, these cheese curds seemed fluffier than the standard issue cheese curd.  Condiment options include ranch dressing, honey mustard sauce and a spicy sriracha mayo.  While I'm not ready to ordain these cheese curds as the best in Madison, they are definitely in the conversation.  (For you curdophiles in the audience, I encourage you to read Lori J's detailed review on chzcurd.com).

For a new restaurant, service was top notch.  The person at the counter explained the different menu options, the food was promptly delivered and both our server and one of the owners stopped by our table to ask what we thought.  This bodes well for future success.  Once they remedy the bun conundrum, OSS Madison easily moves into four star territory.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The goods.  The absolute, gyro goods.

I needed a gyro.  I found this joint.  I got a gyro.  I am happy.

Seriously, I don't know about anything else they serve, but the gyros are top tier.  Chicago worthy.  Chocked full of meat and sauce and onions and tomato.  The pita was even good.  Heck, the paper they wrapped it in even tasted good...I mean, uhm...

Anyway, the service was good.  The inside is a joint.  The outside is a joint with joint-like parking.  Next to it is the 'licka' sto' so you can buy some Flamin' Hot chips to go with your gyro.  The only way to eat.

The price is right, too.  My gyro was only $4.60, which is a whole dollar less than my usual gyro spot.  I saw a slider on the dollar menu (you don't usually see dollar menus in places like this) that I will have to partake of.  

I would put my name on their gyros anytime, and I fully recommend this place for it.  If you've never been here before, keep an eye peeled for it or you'll pass it up.  Its on the corner of Osborn and 24th...next to the brake/tune up place.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>May be one of Middleton's best kept secrets... I had run past Paul's on numerous mornings and always figured the illumated "Open" sign was an oversight.

Turns out they really are open at 7am each morning, and that they do indeed serve breakfast, including a prime rib breakfast on Sundays! While I haven't had breakfast from Paul's yet, I can confirm that it smells great!

We did enjoy a few rounds of drinks while at Paul's last night, and really had a good time.  The establishment is smoke-free (a HUGE bonus in our book), and is laid out in such a manner that the place doesn't feel crowded, even when it's busy.

The service was top notch; we never waited or wanted for anything, and we enjoyed watching the cook prepare a wide variety of bar fare with impeccible precision and ease. 

The chicken tenders looked amazing, as did the bacon cheeseburgers with grilled onions. Portions were astronomically huge, and the most expensive menu item was $6.75. I can't wait to go there for dinner some night.

We finished our drinks, paid our tab, thanked the staff and headed home. We were thrilled with Paul's and will definitely be back. We'll update with a report on the food quality as well, but I have a feeling that it won't disappoint.

Go here for: drinks, after work gatherings, breakfast, and to enjoy what appears to be excellent "bar food" (burgers, fries, onion rings, chicken tenders, etc).</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>First Yelp review....hopefully this inspires the whole city to try this new taco spot!

Garnachas just opened, and that is apparent in how clean and organized this place is.  They have a bar and a restaurant which is cool, a cold Dos Equis and tacos is always close to perfect.  Along with a perfect location on Valley View in between Sahara and Desert Inn, this place is destined for success. 

So I walk in the bar entrance and was immediately greeted by the owner.  Dude was cool without putting on his "welcome new customer" spiel.  He shows me the menu board and explains my options. I decide to get 4 different tacos (pastor, carnitas, chicken and braised beef") along with rice and beans.  Bottled Coke is an automatic! Garnachas does the line different than El Gordo or Taco Y Taco.... Its more assembly line which allows you to "build your own" on top of your taco. Service was fast and friendly.  All of the tacos were hot and moist and had a ton of flavor.  Topped with Jalapeño salsa, i could've eaten more than the 4 but I showed restraint.  The only thing I would change would be the rice, it was kinda of plain and just hasn't as good as it should be.  The owner thanked me for the comment and said was going to have 2 different kinds of upgraded rice very soon.  

4 tacos, rice and beans and a bottled Coke was $12 bucks.  Leaving full and satisfied.  Free chips and salsa bar is also a nice touch.  Keep up the good work, I will be a regular for sure!!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Love this place. What can I say and it is not because of the fact that I can walk to it. Now granted the only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because of the fact that it desperately needs a remodel. 

The food is excellent and the service is seriously so good, you almost want to tuck one of your little Asian servers in your pocket and take them home with you and make them an indentured servant of some sort or slave.

But on a serious note, this is one of those hidden little gems you almost don't want to yelp about due to the fact that you don't want a ton of people to find about it and ruin it.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>A friend gave me a bag of these and they are amazing! My favorite is the cinnamon almonds but there are several flavors like Lemon, Cayenne, Cocoa and they are delicious! 

You can find these at your local Spouts and Costco but I was pleased to find out that these can be purchased as gifts on their website!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Just stopped in for my first Firehouse Sub and I wasn't disappointed. I had the medium pastrami sandwich on white bread. The bread was fresh, a little crispy, and very tasty. The pastrami itself was cut thick and also had a great flavor. They have a hot sauce bar loaded with great, hard-to-find, hot sauces. The only complaint I have is that it does take a little while to get your sandwich, about 10-15 min. Now this certainly didn't ruin the experience for me and to be fair, they were getting slammed with orders. Overall, it is very easy to recommend this sub shop. I'll certainly be coming back...next time for a Smokehouse Beef &amp; Cheddar Brisket!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Took my mom for Mother's Day after seeing a show at Paris.  The popovers were outstanding.  Flaky, Cheesy, Salty Deliciousness.  We shared the Bone In Rib-eye which took almost 45 minutes to be served, and it was undercooked.  Although it was very flavorful, it was not a good cut of meat.  I am not sure if I have ever seen a tendon in the middle of a rib-eye, but this one had a large one running through it.  It was overall a fatty piece of steak.  The Bone In at Joe's is far superior for the same price.  The service was slow even though there were many servers present.  Did I mention the popovers were amazing?  Probably would  not go back.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Hadn't been in here for quite a while &amp; definitely not to eat. Picked it fairly randomly as it's close to a friend's flat.


 Service was good and just shy of intrusive up till it came time to pay the bill at which point the staff were nowhere to be seen so we had to hover at the bar to settle up. My gnocchi starter was tasty although there was rather too much tomato sauce, the tuna steak main course was also good but could have done with a potato or two as spinach as the main veg accompaniment was a little bit boring. Only one Rose on the menu but at £11.50 it was as well priced as it was drinkable (a Fair Trade product to boot).


 A good selection of tunes at a comfortable volume further enhanced the experience &amp; I can see myself venturing back here.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Great location if staying near the convention center or in downtown Phoenix. This is by far one of the best sports bars I have ever been to. I had a perfect view of ESPN 2 and the place had plenty of sporting events on other teles..but not too many. 

The atmosphere is fantastic and perfect for lunch. Food is great and they had vegetarian options, a major plus for a sports bar. What is better than veggie options? They made exceptions for me, my whole meal sans dairy with no complaints, evil eyes, etc. This is greatly appreciated. 

The evening scene is great also. 

An overall 5.5 stars. hellz yeah.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I had high expectations - the friends I went with have raved about this place for years. And true to their word we received a warm greeting from the owner and good service throughout the meal. The decor is basic, but experience has taught me that this is rarely reflected in an Indian kitchen so my expectations kept climbing.


 Then the menu; all the standards, but a few dishes I had never encountered before and which were screaming out to be tried. I plumped for the Balti Chasni Gosht, a curry that promised lots of heat and flavour. Ah well, being let down by a curry is probably not the worst thing that will ever happen to me, but the sadness still lingers.. I have heard rumours of such practises, but had never before had first hand experience of what lurked in the bottom of my balti dish: Pre-cooked lamb dropped into a goo of a curry sauce and reheated. The lamb was horrid, the sauce okish, though it had a disconcerting flavour of fish.


 If the meal hadn't been a treat from my hosts I would have said something, but I didn't. So I am now.


 The stars are for the service, the prices and the hope that this was an off night.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>SO Glad I found these guys again! In case you somehow don't yet know, after the original Triple Play closed, the cook set-up shop here, adjacent/adjoined to Boodles. The place is pretty cozy, but it's clean and comfortable....and it's the only place to get your hands on an original Triple Play cheesesteak. It's every bit as perfect as it used to be, too. I was near devastated when, after only a handful of visits, the old place cut-off my cheesesteak connection by closing down...and I know I'm not alone. Well, dry your eyes, Las Vegas, they're back! So stop in, help re-support a Vegas institution  and take advantage of the glorious rebirth of the undisputed best Philly Cheesesteak in NV. You'll be glad you did, especially when you see how genuinely happy they seem to have you come in. And yeah, while I don't think it's the entire oldschool menu, it's all of the classics and favorites....done exactly right. Booyah!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is the newest addition to the Omelet House Family. It is also located on N. Boulder Hwy but it is located a little more north at Russell and Boulder. 

Slightly hung over one morning a friend and I went to grab some good food to start the day off right. She wanted Roberto's so we pulled up to the drive thru got our breakfast burritos and started to drive home. All of the sudden she freaked out, "THE NEW OMELET HOUSE IS OPEN!!! WE HAVE TO GO WE MUST GO!" 

I got very excited because we just bought food, still hot in my lap, and this place made her want to forget that just so we could eat here. SO we dropped the food off at home put some real pants on and went to Omelet House. 

No being a virgin to this place I had no idea what kind of reputation the other locations had. I heard all about it as we ordered and got our food. 

I was blown away. Warm Banana Nut Loaf, an Omelet as big as my head, and the BEST Potato Spuds. As other yelpers have said- they are magical and addictive. I had the Guac omelet with guacamole tomatoes and cheddar cheese, my friend had the health nut with jalapenos. 

We both didn't finish it all, and ended up only taking the left over loaf home since we had breakfast burritos still waiting for us. 

The building is nice and had an eclectic feel to it full of ceramic roosters and other pictures all over its walls. This building use to be a Sizzler so you will still see the Salad Bar chillin in the center of the restaurant. I know by the end of this month they are going to start serving dinner so hopefully it will get some use. Its roomy and inviting to say the least. 

And don't worry the manager said they won't be closing any of the other locations so you can still get all your favs in the usual spot. 
I am looking forward to going back here, and if you are a virgin like I was bring your appetite and head on down to the Omelet House!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Update! They fixed all the issues I wrote previously, girls are always nice at night and remembered us every time. We have since moved up to north Scottsdale, and will miss out late night splurges.


This place is seriously addicting, they have new flavors everyday which they let you try all of them if you'd like. 
Since stumbling upon this place with my girlfriend, we've been going at least 3 times a week. 

Only cons I have are the place still looks under construction, I love banana splits and the put them in a huge foam cup and give you a long spoon that just bends and becomes a pain to eat with. Also the hours are strange, went the other day around 3 but they weren't opening til 5pm?! 

Minus those little things the custard nonetheless is pretty amazing!

    <review:review_text>Del Taco is the best fast food taco place by far..this place blows Taco H(b)ell out of the water, and two Del Classic Chicken Burritos for 5 bucks. INSANE!!!!

So I had a craving the other night around 1:30 in the morning so I started to think outside the box...:) then I remembered!!! Read my reviews of Taco Bell for further explanation. 

So Jack in the box's grease filled 99 cent tacos just didn't seem appealing to me. So I drove way out of my way to go to the nearest Del Taco. So I got the 2 Del classic Chicken burritos and two chicken soft taco's they were all delicious, and they also have these new jalapeno rings which are like onion rings except they are hot jalapenos they are so good. I am seriously hooked on these bad boys!!!

All in all Del Taco filled the void that was in my stomach. I really enjoyed this place would have to say this is more of like a 3 and a half star place though the do lose some stars because It took a while to make my order for a fast food joint and was still a bit pricey besides the 2 for 5 deal. Yelp needs a half a star system. I would say 3 1/2 stars!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Gross! I generally love Papa Johns, but this one is lacking in all areas. I ordered PJs for lunch and once it finally arrived (1 hour later), it was luke warm and soggy. Apart from that, the staff lacks any work ethic or customer service. The three people I dealt with were all rude and careless. Initially, they ended up giving me a $5 credit. Ha! As if I would order again anyway.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>New business that is struggling somewhat?
Their customer contact is very business like with no warmth. 
The food quality is ok for the price. However, call me old fashion but I think soup should be served hot. Mine was delivered warm and you felt rushed to eat it before it went to room temperature. Also they were out of a menu item and still sold it to me. They did refund the money after they realized that they were out of some of the ingredients.
Also saw other customers going up and getting it themselves instead of servers taking it out. We did not experience that situation but did observe it.
This just opened and management has work to do.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Did you know almonds are good for you? That's right -- they can alleviate headache, are full of antioxidants, and curb your appetite, too.

So, if you needed another reason to indulge your craving for the nuts, now you have it.

Almond Brothers primarily features candied nuts, including their signature cinnamon roasted almonds, which my kids loved but I didn't care for. 

I did, however, love their fudge. They also have a nice variety of gift baskets and other items on their website.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place is much better after the smoking ban took effect...for some reason this place has a terrible ventilation system, and even when I was a smoker I couldn't stand the eye-burning smoky interior.

That said, it's fun to go on a Tuesday for 2 for 1...lots of guys and a generally positive environment.  All the TVs tend to be a distraction when everyone is really there just to check out the crowd and drink, although I think on slower days there may be some genuinely sports minded guys.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The McManager sucks.  (he wouldn't run his store Safeway card for me!)

The debit/credit card swipers suck! (they don't fit in their holders and they must use a freakin' dialup modem they are so God Damn slow)

They once completely ran out of MILK!

Their change machine was down for well over a week!

I swear to God, if  there were any alternative in the vicinity I'd GLADLY pay twice the price to shop there! 

Revamped store is nice to look at, shitty to shop at!  

Now with free Wi-Fi! 

EAT ME!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Very nice staff and seating area. Two machines and video poker at the bar. All the food I saw go by looked great. My Asian chicken salad looked good but eh on taste. Very bitter greens and cold chicken. The hot wings were moist &amp; good on flavor. Next time I will try the grilled cheese or sandwich. Salad needs work</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>First day open and I was very excited to try Kneaders! I was not disappointed. The restaurant looks great, and the location is perfect for the area. The pricing was better than I expected, and the serving sizes were big for the money. I only got to try breakfast and a smoothie, but if this is an indicator I will absolutely be going back</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>4.5 stars, and worth the drive to the hood!  The billboards of the giant super 3-lb. burrito finally cast a spell on me, and I took the plunge.

La Tolteca is not quite as full service as Ranch Market, but it's somewhat of a smaller version where you'll find a counter-service deli, panaderia, carniceria, jugeria, and a mini-market here.  Even better is their cooking tools section (where you can buy huge tamale steamers, and mortar and pestles for making chile) and the catering menu which starts at $5 per person.  Holy crap.  What a steal.  

Upon entrance you'll see the deep pit outside where some man is grilling all the carne you'll find served inside.  As you step inside you'll see some brisk business - I found all sorts of types and ethnicities here - a young couple on a date, some girls gabbing over lunch and others ordering food and pastries to go.

The food here ROCKS.   It's very authentic, cooked by commadres and tias just like back home.   The Grandma quotient on the beans and rice was very high -- always a standard assessment in my quest for good Mexican food.  They have every imaginable burrito type here and they're huge and cheap - at $4.  I always opt for the veggie (rice, beans, cheese and guacamole) burrito and am always impressed - the best part being the freshly made tortillas.  I even bought some on my way out to take home.

The tacos are a good choice too.  The combo plates start at $5.  The carne asada (a little overcooked) was pretty good and delicious in a flavorful marinade, and the shrimp taco was really good - a much better choice I would add.  Paired with some tamarind, strawberry agua fresca or horchata and you'll be in heaven.

I find the bakery to be the highlight regarding the food.  The pandulce was excellent - if a bit more fresh (than Ranch Market) given the way it's stored behind a glass case rather than self-service.  The conchas and pineapple empanadas were soft, sweet and delicious - with perfect texture.  Everything from churros, to cakes, to flan, to sweet breads, to donuts and rolls.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Food is insanely good.  Fresh meats and very, very tasty.  When you order a sandwich (i recommend the godfather I or II), the owner goes to the fridge and begins slicing cuts for your sub.  Doesn't get much fresher than that.  They have a few tables, but I've never eaten there so I cannot comment on the service but they are always friendly when I order take out.  In addition to a plethora of sandwich options there are italian dishes as well.  I've had the lasagna which was a large, flavorful portion.  Desserts are great too.  Try a Cannoli.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I really wanted to like this place. It's a great concept and it seems family owned.  I think with a few tweeks they can actually get it right.  I've been twice and both orders had the same problems. 

First,  the burritos are small.  On top of the already small burrito,  most of the scant filling is veggies or rice.  The amount of protein is relatively small.  Several bites had no protein at all. I was still hungry after both meals. 


I had the Seoul, a pork Korean inspired burrito.  Barely any pork.  A LOT of cabbage which made it rather bland.  Then I had the Seattle, a fish burrito with barely any fish and lots of cabbage. 

For the price (around $7) the should be a lot more meat in them and the meat is it what contained the flavor.  It would solve the bland problem.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>A $2.00 ice cream sandwich is a great deal already, but the friendly service bumps this up to a 5 star business for me. Sam and Tina are very warm and welcoming, they make my friends and I feel right at home everytime we stop in, which is quite frequently! The cookies are homemade and perfect for an ice cream sandwich; as some others have said, soft and chewy, yet holds up to a big chomp combined with the ice cream. Their brownie a la mode is really good too, and the tiramisu, while a little more expensive ($3.75) is delicious! Great to see a local business doing well, I will continue to support Slickables!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The largest co-op in town has a great selection of organic groceries and their amazing produce section even carries kumquats when they're in season! I love it! The deli and the vegetarian offerings there can't be beat, and this is also a great place to find vitamin and health supplements, as well as bulk grains, nuts, etc. My only qualm is with the service: the cashiers often give off that Seattle-record-store-clerk vibe of looking down on all who dare enter the checkout lane.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We are constantly on the quest for pizza that is not from Papa Barfs, Domino's and Pizza Hut.  Why bother when there are some many better options throughout the valley.

We tried out Johnnie's recently and liked it a lot.  We had the peperoni Joannie style (this is the middle crust, not the thin and not the thickest).  It was pretty darn good.

The sauce is a bit sweeter than what I like but I still enjoyed it.  It was quick and it is convenient for our location.  The gal who answered the phone and took our order was really nice, she called me "Honey" and I liked that b/c I could tell she was older than me and that is the only time I like being called "honey" unless from my husband... or a gay man.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The first review was dead on!! My wife and I came in to see if this was another false recommendation, but to our surprise it was dead on. The food was out of this world and the prices were spot on. You definitely got what you paid for everything was so fresh and a lot of pride was taken in the perpetration. The only down fall was the lap dance going on between the bartender and what we found out later to be the owner good thing it's 21 and over because it was definitely a nc17 show. We will be coming back again to try more of the food. Maybe lunch next time.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I recently ate here and had a decent meal.  I ordered an Italian beef Sandwich.  It was good,  but not as good as some other places Ive tried in the valley for Italian Beef (Luke's is my favorite so far).  The bread they serve before dinner was good, although the waitress forgot to bring it out in a timely manner. Bar area looks nice for a casual drink. Ill stop back here again and will probably try one of their pasta dishes or maybe the thin crust pizza.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We took a detour from the usual Jersey Mike's lunch today and ended up next door at the newly opened Tacos and Beer.  5 stars for a taco place!?  Yeah yeah, I'm breaking my own rule that no place that serves everyday food should get more than 4 stars but the extra star is to keep this place going so I can come back for lunch over and over.  

The tacos are excellent...not as big as a "Los Tacos" taco but very tasty.  Definitely an artisan concept as other reviewers say.  Everything we tried was complex in ingredients and flavor (as much as you can pack into a street taco sized portion).  Our table tried out almost all the tacos on the menu and there was an overall preference for the various pork tacos but they were all good.

Service was fantastic but we need to go back to re-review as traffic was light today and it seemed all the staff was focused on a few tables.  Hope more people start going so they can continue to do well.
  
Definitely looking to go back after work to try all the beers....oh yeah...the tomatillo salsa was the best I've had in a while.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We went to the Witchery for a late lunch after walking around the Castle.  Heard it was one of the best restaurants in Edinburgh and it lived up to expectations.

For starter I had the assiette of charcuterie which was pretty good.  I selected the Fisherman's Pie as my main which was pretty good, not your normal heavy and creamy pie.  My friend got the lunch set menu and really liked it as well.

I also give them props b/c while other groups were there in suits, I walked in dressed like a scrub off the street (read as: underarmour...  seriously) but they still gave us respectable service (not sure I would have).  Overall a really good restaurant a nice change of pace from normal pub food at most other establishments around the city.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The buffet here was surprisingly good here! Sam's town was a little far from the strip, but the buffet and laser/water show was worth it. They served a pretty good variety of food here. They had some italian, mexican, chinese and all the in betweens. What was so awesome here was the variety of ice cream you could eat. There's about 12 flavors and I had a double scoop of mint and cookies/cream. So yummy! I recommend this place! Also the price was awesome...$10 for lunch!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We have had season tickets to the Pops series for three years now. We love us our music! Last night we saw again the wonderful jim Witter who did a tribute to one of my favs of all times, Simon and Garfunkle. ( I know every word to every song they ever wrote. Yes I know nerd alert here) JW usually does a Billy Joel and Elton John tribute. Ha! Last year I even got to sing and dance on stage to Crocodile Rock. Na-na-na-na-na  Na-na-na-na-na!  Don't ask, but life goal number 1 completed! LOL! Well as far as last night goes, all I can say is that we were rocking the place. ( Well ok as far as one can rock out to Simon and Garfunkle) I am sure the conductor was cringing at how rowdy the third row was. Teeehhhee! We were jamming out to the music. 
( Yes sorry handsome conductor man. I know it is the Symphony and probably made you cringe with all that classical training in the house. Then the NY, Alice Cooper gang hooligan types came in-hahaha thus why I like the Pops more than the classical. I will go to classical shows too so really I am just kidding. However. I do love the pops so much more. I know, I know, I feel like "Just Jack" from Will and Grace. I love me my musical theater and showtunes, Gleek here.  
   Last year I even got to see my all time musical theater hero diva perform,  Patti Lupone. SIGH! Got to meet her after the show too. Thanks Phoenix Symphony for that photo op! (Life goal number two, check!) Advice, now if you could only get Mandy I would truly be in heaven. ( Life goal check number 3 perhaps?) 
   However, I do went to point out they do have something for everyone with an eclectic yearly calendar of different musical genres. I do worry about cultural Arts programs and budget cuts in Az so hope people continue to support them in any fashion. I know it is not NY or London but it's still good!  I also love it when I see the young set being introduced to the Symphony. We sat next to a delightful 13 year old young man last night. He was rocking out with us. ( Ok Dad listens to S/G in the car every day. But at least the boy didn't  appear to be having his teeth pulled out by being there)  So to all of my fellow music lovers, check it out, support local Arts, and enjoy!

Oh an afterthought- The person who sings with Jim ( can't remember his name) does the meanest, most awesome, best impression of Edith Bunker ever. I have no idea how a man can even hit a high note like that. If you ever have the chance to see him do this I would strongly advise you to do so. It is so fun!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Review based on Sprinkles' invite-only Sneak Peek event on Wednesday, March 19th!

I received an e-mail from Sprinkles last week inviting me and a guest for a taste prior to their grand opening. The tasting involved complimentary cupcakes (2) and ice cream. Very exciting!  We arrived approximately 15-20 minutes before the event (2PM-4PM) and there was already quite the line. We were checked off a list and given cupcake and ice cream menus. The event was pretty organized as they allowed a certain amount of people in at one time as to not overcrowd the intimate shop.

The boutique is adorable! Bright colors, their script logo, Sprinkles dots, and treats galore. On the left side of their space is the counter to order cupcakes and beverages. The cupcakes are displayed to your right, flavors labeled with wooden blocks. There were also doggie cupcakes ($2.50) and their "store" where you can purchase shirts ($25-40), onesies ($25), cupcake mixes ($14), and a crazy adorable miniature toy replica of a Sprinkles boutique ($16)! On the other side of their boutique is the ice cream counter. There are also two entrances. On the exterior wall, facing O'Sheas, is the very cool Cupcake ATM that is open 24 hours!

My guest, Christina, and I bought opted for the Salty Caramel ice cream (one scoop, $3.75) in a Red Velvet waffle cone ($1). I really wanted to try the Coffee Fudge Almond, but they didn't have any! The Salty Caramel was really sweet and much too salty; it was difficult to eat. The Red Velvet cone was delicious! Soft, crunchy, and great flavor. It's a must with your ice cream!

We shared four cupcakes ($3.75/each): Chocolate Coconut (Belgian dark chocolate with coconut cream cheese frosting), Ginger Lemon (Spiced ginger cake with lemon cream cheese frosting), Red Velvet, and Strawberry. By the way, I love the wooden utensils with "Sprinkles" etched in their handles! We took these home to enjoy since there are only 4-5 seats and a small table facing outside. The cupcakes were all very moist, but didn't have spectacular flavor. Strawberry was our favorite with the best cake flavor and frosting. Yummy and not overly sweet. I didn't care for the chocolate, ginger, or red velvet cakes. The ginger flavor was just okay and it was difficult to detect lemon in the frosting. The chocolate and red velvet didn't taste like much. I did like the coconut frosting very much. I've had prior experience with Sprinkles cupcakes and they're not my favorite, however, there are certain flavors that I really enjoy. The Strawberry was wonderful and I loved the German Chocolate offered last Fall.

FYI: Sprinkles is located next to Brooklyn Bowl, near the High Roller. They're open Sunday thru Wednesday 10AM-12AM and Thursday thru Saturday 10AM-1AM. There is a schedule for their cupcake and ice cream flavors, so if you're looking for something in particular, view their website before your visit!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>First of all, this is Culvers.  I love the mushroom and swiss burger, delicious, I crave it and I am not a fast food person!   They custards are to die for and I am glad that I do not live by a culvers because I would probably try to eat there every day!  I love their food, service has always been great here!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Great place with delicious food! When you advertise yourself as serving "pure clean food with a twist," you had better live up to expectations! And Blue Lemon does. 

I've been there twice now, once to dine in and once for takeout, and was pretty blown away each time.

This is a counter-order restaurant, and I actually like that since it cuts down on price and dining wait time. The food is indeed healthy and served very well. The ingredients are pretty great, too. I was really surprised at the number of sun-dried tomatoes in my fettucine alfredo. Those, along with a generous amount of portobello mushrooms and spinach, made this dish a nice surprise.

My favorite thing on the menu has to be the tomato bisque soup. It is truly excellent. My son pronounced the kids' chicken tenders meal as excellent, and I saw kids at a nearby table devouring their macaroni.

Nice decor and atmosphere, too.

Like the previous reviewer, I also think the digital menus were a little hard to read, but the line wasn't long for me at all. The staff tries to make it easier on you by giving you takeout menus to read while in line, but I think once people become familiar with the menu and concept those complaints will go away.

In a land of gross chain restaurants with tons of fried, fatty food, I'm so glad that this place has landed in my neighborhood.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>As this is LITERALLY my favorite restaurant, I can't believe it's taken me until now to review it.  I carry a bottle of Smoky Jon's sauce with me when I go to other places to eat.  That's how good it is.  The pulled pork and brisket sandwiches are excellent.  I can put down a 1/3 slab of ribs, a pulled pork sandwich and their super-excellent fries with a side of corn like it's nothing.

My only small gripe is that sometimes, after about 7:00 PM (they close at 9), the ribs seem like they can be a little over-done.  (Not as tender)

Smoky Jon's turns me into a pig, and I love every delicious mouthful.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Burger joint that just opened in the palms so you know I had to try it. Walked up and grabbed a seat at the bar and ordered to go. The bartenders were really nice and helpful. My coworker told me to try the buffalo chicken burger. So I order that, no tomatoes. The gentleman that took my order was super nice. Asked me about me day and what department I worked in, all the good stuff. 

What I like most is it's a new place and it smells clean. There was staff everywhere I turned and they were helping each guest, asking how the food was and also if they needed anything else. I think they asked me if I wanted water like 3 times. 

Anywho, they also have patio seats and it will probably be packed when they open the pool.

Back to the food... I got my burger and left to eat at my desk. It was good but I feel like it could have been a little better could use some more buffalo sauce, otherwise the celery and blue cheese was awesome! It was in the burger, something different and I liked it. May be a little pricy, $11 per burger. We shall see how long they last.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I haven't tried to many items from here, but the chicken parm was good, I had some chicken dish for lunch one day that wasn't the best.  The bread was fresh from the oven so the butter melted as soon as you spread it, and the free post meal sherbert is the 4th star!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Before the ownership scandal of 2005, Pel'meni would have received 5 stars. The dumplings are perfectly seasoned reasonably priced amazing morsels of goodness.  Back then you were allotted unlimited sour cream, a soda, and of course your 20 dumplings for $5.  The spicy dumplings were a bi or tri weekly meal for quite a while.  However now that the new owner has taken over, they now charge extra for soda,have unpredictable hours, sometimes just don't have potato dumplings, and (most insulting) I found a stray beef dumpling in my potato. Ack. I may never return.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I agree with Gibson A, the service, food and price are all flawless!!

It's got such a strong atmosphere, you'll struggle to find one like this  anywhere else. The staff are LOVELY, I feel proud to be able to give them credit on here because they deserve it.

The music is a bit dodgy though, I would have preferred something a bit more upbeat but hey, can't get everything right!!

I had the noodles with chicken in a pak choi sauce or something like that, and it was delicious. Really fragrant and really tasty! And reasonable!! I'll be back</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The good news:  Big Catch is the best thing these folks have done in a long time!

The bad news:  As soon as we made it a habit to pick up a Big Catch -- they killed it.

The good news.  The staff here is very pleasant and have to say "I'm sorry" a lot, but they do it with aplomb.  

The bad news.  They have to say "I'm sorry" so much because of a lousy ordering system where they are always out of something.  Soft drinks one day, shrimp another day, onion rings another day.

But, since I seem to know what they are out of so often, I must like it enough to keep coming back.

I miss the Big Catch!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Panda Garden is the best place to get Chinese food in Sun Prairie. And they deliver which is a plus in my book! I've eaten in the restaurant a couple of times, but usually do take out. I've never had anything I didn't like there (and we've tried a very good array of items). Tonight we had the Garlic Shrimp and Chicken Lo Mein. Both were awesome! The Garlic Shrimp had a nice spicy kick to it, but still had a TON of flavor! The crab Rangoon and pot stickers are also tasty!  Pricing is very reasonable for what you get!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Normally when to comes to pizza night, we get takeout from Villa or Rosatis, or delivery from Papa Johns. My husband thought it was time we changed it up a bit, so we decided to pick up a pie, salad and wings from Dominos. 

Service was fairly friendly. There was one female employee that made a poor impression by getting in the way of the employee trying to help me and generally looking like she'd rather die then do her job. Thankfully the person that actually helped me did so with a great attitude and a smile.

I was surprised at the quality of the pizza from Dominos. The crust was perfectly cooked and had great flavor. The wings were meaty but not extra cripsy, which is how I always order them. The salad was nothing special. 

Overall our order was better then I expected it to be. We will certainly order from Domino's again.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Mo burger looked so good from a distance the place physically is great tv's and plugs for your phone. Then the food came, I ordered a single mo burger not knowing how big it would actually be and when they brought it out it was TINY. When I mean tiny I mean it was half the size of a kids cheeseburger at mc donalds. I would have been embarrassed to serve that to an adult its a tiny tiny burger. it literally took 3 bites to eat. Maybe it was half the size of a white castle burger. All three bites were fine but for the price of the meal around 10 bucks with a drink and fries it was the WORST burger I have ever had and I have had thousands. I would advise anyone walking by this place keep walking go to johnny rockets it cant be any worse than this was. I even complained to the girl working there how small the burger was and she didn't seem to care. AVOID AT ALL COSTS if you want to eat and not be hungry when you leave.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I'm very sad to have to give this place three stars. I've been on pins and needles just waiting for this place to open, only to be disappointed. I averaged out my food and staff scores to come out to the three star rating, This is why...

The food: Two stars for the food.
 I ordered the Phad Thai Noodles with shrimp. In the description it says "Thin spicy Thai rice noodles stir fried with egg, bean sprouts, and green onions." This made me really want to try this and being it was supposed to be a spicy dish I was really excited. But no it was sweet not spicy. Plus, the shrimp where fried and terribly overdone. Being diabetic I can not do a sweet dish like this. If they would have stated it was sweet I would not have ever picked it. It was not spicy AT ALL! Even my husband who really can not handle spicy things said it was not spicy.

My husband choose the HK Style Crispy Noodles which came with ALL the proteins and a bunch of traditional Chinese veggies. Overall it was ok. The shrimp again WAY overcooked. The sauce totally lacked flavor. It tasted like someone just used a bullion cube and called it a day.

We are thinking the crappy shrimp and lack of flavor in the sauce may have had to do with it being end of day. My husband's order was unnaturally hot, like it had been sitting heating all day. 

Staff: Four stars for the Staff.
The staff could not have been nicer that is why it kills me to write such a bad review. When we visited China A Go Go it was a Tuesday night at about 8:30pm. The staff had us sit down while we looked over the menu and did not rush us at all. They even brought us out wonton chips with sweet and sour sauce. We got our food quickly. 


We are willing to give it a second try being that they are a new business here in Henderson. I really want to give their sushi a try. It does look a bit expensive, but if it's good, it will be worth it. I'll update my review when we visit again.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place has wonderful sushi! You order, they make it and it comes straight to the table. They have alot of good rolls and tons to choose from. Plus their all you can eat isn't super pricy and everything on the menu is included except sashimi. The only problem with the all you can eat is it is regular sized rolls so its worth it if your a big eater. I only made it to two rolls but my husband had at least 8! The service was really freindly as well. I will be going back next time we go out for sushi.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Situated across from Salt and Pepper and the outstanding Mediterranean Gate, Global Deli has a couple of big-hitters in the sandwich / wrap trade to contend with. For my money, it can't quite compete with those two for the top prizes, but is still good enough to be more than worth a visit.

Nothing too out of the ordinary, with a menu dominated by sandwiches, paninis and soups, but all fresh, tasty and inexpensive enough to pick up a solid four stars.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Just had some FANTASTIC pizza at Papa Christos. It's PACKED for lunch every day of the week. There's a reason why locals keep coming back. 

My wife and I had pepperoni and the vegie pizza with spinach, feta and mushrooms. 

Excellent! Very fresh ingredients. Hot out of the oven. Served fast.

Met the owner (Horatio). He's very friendly. From Romania. Family owned.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Personally I like McDonald's better.  I had a cheeseburger with tator tots and the flavor was lacking.  The chicken strips were good.  My son loved those.  I was so excited to try Sonic for the first time and was greatly disappointed. Maybe we will try something else next time we are near a Sonic.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>So glad this place finally opened!  I had been wanting pizza for a good month, and I remembered they were open late night.  

It's a cute little space with a rad mural inside.  They offer cheese or pepperoni by the slice $3 and $3.50, and they have whole pies as well (12'' for $12 and 18'' for $18 plus more if you want to add toppings) and they always have some kind of delicious special going (which is only available by the pie, just an fyi).

I don't think this place is pricey, especially considering all of the fancy pizza places that popped up.  This place is a no bull pizza joint, and the fact that they are open from 8pm-4am Tuesday-Saturday is an added bonus!  I think this place is PERFECT for a late night snack after an evening of barhopping with friends or for restaurant workers (who usually get out too late to enjoy anything other than something berto's or Denny's). They don't deliver just yet, but are fully planning on doing so:) 

When I stopped in, I ordered two slices of cheese.  The crust is thinner, but not super crunchy like thin crust.  It has a nice little crunch with a pillowy texture inside.  Good sauce, good cheese made by good peeps.  My friends decided to join me, so I ordered a slice of pepperoni and they ordered pepperoni with mushrooms and jalapenos.  No one was disappointed and we all have been talking about it since we dined there last week!

Lastly, the crew is great! Nice and friendly, playing great tunes and having a good time making pizza and chatting with customers.

Can't wait to go back!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>So you wonder, (as you wander) does Phoenix have any history that pre-dates 1911? What happened to all the old brick and western style buildings that housed, cotton, supplies, cactus jelly, or whatever Phoenix would have had stored in a warehouse in 1911?  Well this is a place that has history (albeit, only 80 years or so, but hey we'll take it.) Coming from Boston, I yearn to have some kind of architectural history, buildings that have meaning, purpose,  character. I mean how many adobe style, clay shingled buildings can we have seriously? 

So if your looking for cool atmosphere, a safe venue (well lite parking lots) and great music, check out the brick house. I saw Okkerivil River here, and the experience was great, and the venue is the perfect size for a small show. They serve a wide range of beer and drinks. (food too) My only complaint, it was pretty hot inside, but then again it's ALWAYS hot inside buildings here in September. 

Check it out, you won't be disappointed.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We were invited for the soft opening. We were sat immediately which was nice. The Chicken combo with medium, Asiago Parmesan and Strawberry hot. All were really good. The fish fry was really tasty and enjoyable. Meaty beast pizza was exactly what I expected, delicious. Clam Chowder was awful, much like glue, skip this for sure. Staff were friendly. A bit loud but that just tells you I'm old.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Yummy doughnuts!!! 

Not a fan when It comes to peanut butter flavored things but omg, the peanut butter cheesecake doughnut is just something I think about after I've had it! It's a glazed doughnut then stuffed with the pb-cheesecake filling topped off with whipped cream and sprinkled with butterfinger bits! Must try! 

Barvarian cream also really good!! My hubby likes the s'mores and my kiddies love the fruit bar. Can't wait to try more!

And I love the location it's in town square so we don't have to drive far!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>My conclusion after dining here for the first time is that hubby and I  have had all of these menu items before- and done better at other restaurants. The chips, carne asada, and carnitas were all sub-par. The rice was pretty good, however, as was the guacamole. The waiter had no clue about what type were the beers listed on the menu. The one shining star was the flan: perfectly smooth and creamy, and one of the best I've ever had. I'll be back for dessert- but ONLY for that.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I stopped by on Day 2 of it's opening. All the sandwiches are served with chimichurri sauce and voila, you get the restaurant's name. There are about 5 different sandwich options as well as a few empanada choices. All the sandwiches are served on bread similar to that of a torta and when it comes right down to it, they basically are tortas-served on a loaf rather than a round. Meat, cheese, lettuce, peppers, mayo...if it tastes like a torta, looks like a torta, it is one. And I think this is where the restaurant will stumble. Sandwiches here go around $9.00 (accompanied by a smattering of fries). For a slightly lower price, you can go to the numerous Mexican restaurants that serve a far superior sammy.  The chimichurri sauce is solid but they need to mix it up (different flavor profiles, etc) if they want to make it for the long haul.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Stopped by here for dinner -  This is my mom and dad's favorite place for chinese food ...  So I met them here with my nephews. 
We had a nice meal ,  a good meal really - Not the same as Lotus which is where I prefer to go, but it is good.
They start the meal with some fried won ton crisps ... and with sweet and sour. 
I had the broccoli beef and lemon chicken , it came with curry puffs and egg roll and rice , I changed out the egg drop soup for won ton soup.
It was a good change.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Mr. Submarine serves basic-duty subs. This is the kind of spot that would have been wiped out by Subway in the 80's, but they keep it going. There's no innovation, just basic subs in a couple of sizes. Choose the meat and bread, whether you want cheese, and a few things to go on top.

I eat there whenever I'm in the area at lunchtime.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I know people are crazy for Culver's. It's an ok place for a custard, but I don't get the butter burger thing. Every meal I've eaten there just hasn't set well on my stomach--especially the "walleye" sandwich. I even tried a salad in an attempt to find something healthy. The lettuce was wilted and what chicken they had on top was uninspired and as dry as a shoe.   I'll keep trying, though. I haven't had any of their soups, and if these are good I'm willing to rethink this review a bit. 

I will say they are very awesome with kids and generous with the free little dishes of custard for them.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Soooo full.

The kid and I were starving. We were headed to Thai BBQ in the same plaza but decided to change things up at the last minute. So into Taste of China we went...

Pretty quiet, clean considering the age of the building and not busy at all. There were two other tables seated and the owner let us pick our table. Bathroom was clean (super plus). Service was quick and friendly.

I ordered the MaPo tofu (I'm a temporary vegetarian and it's been pretty difficult considering the spots we normally patronize...) It was tasty, slightly salty and not as spicy as I had hoped which was my fault for not specifying the level of heat I desired for the day haha. My picky child had the sesame chicken (sauce on the side) and she enjoyed it. Portions were pretty large and came with a side of white rice, some pickled cabbage and a dish of roasted peanuts. We ended up boxing up about 2/3 of our food.

Against my better judgment, I ordered a snow ice... not that it tasted bad... I was just too full and I knew my daughter wouldn't touch it. It was actually really good. For $6.50 you get to choose a base and three toppings plus condensed milk. For an extra dollar you can pick a trio of base flavors; additional toppings are 50¢ each. According to the server, snow ice is a cross between shaved ice and ice cream; "fluffy"she said. #itssofluffyicoulddie. I went with Thai tea as a base and red bean, lychee jelly and egg pudding as toppings with condensed milk drizzled on top. #NOM yeah. Totally finished the entire thing. By myself. Haha.

Dinner for two/dessert for one fat mom = $24 ... scratch that... $19. #awesome.

BOTTOM LINE: cheap (owner gave us 20% off...which I gave right back in tip form), quick, tasty, great service and SNOW ICE. I'll be back.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I was a fan of the Dirty Drummer over in Tempe back during college years at ASU. So when I walked in this location I was happy to see the faithful ASU Banner up near the bar! 

The waitress was really friendly she greeted me promptly and asked what she could get me as if I was a regular. I asked if they still did hot wings and she said why of course 12 for $5. So I ordered them and a cold draft and set back to watch the NFL game in progress. 

The game didn't go my way but the wings came out just perfect as they always have! Hot &amp; crispy with just enough sauce to give them a little bite and not loose the crispiness of the big juicy wings. 

The beer was cold and the shoot of Tequila I had was ample to say the least. Only they don't stock my friend Jose' ...What's up with that so I had some off brand I never heard of call Tres Amigos. It was chilled to the right temperature and slid down easy. 

Can't wait to visit on a Tuesday for that burger special now. 
See ya there?</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>My husband and I got to experience this new steakhouse inside Bally's. The food was great!! We started with the spinach with bacon vignette salad. I was surprised with the flavors of the salad. The blue cheese added to the mixture of flavors. I am normally picky with meat but the filet mignon was so good. I recommend it, it was nice and tender with good flavors. The flavors got more intense with the horseradish sauce I ordered. The mashed potatoes and mushrooms were average. Overall the setting and server service made the night. If you are around the Bally's casino, stop by BLT Steak. You wont be disappointed.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Yes, it's true.  You will hear British accents here. One of the better neighborhood bars in central Phoenix, George &amp; Dragon is also one of the best British pubs in Arizona.  A very friendly and diverse crowd - I made some of my first friends here in AZ at George &amp; Dragon.  

Not exactly like a typical British/Irish pub crowd - as this place is frequented by a more punk-rock, rag-tag, counter-culture bohemian crowd.  Whatevs.  It keeps things interesting.  People playing darts or pool are always up for talking and invite you to join in.  The bartenderesses here are always very nice and well endowed at the same time.

Beer selection is among the best in Central Phoenix it would make any discerning Brooklyn hipster drool with delight. Chimay, Tetley's, Stella Artois, Kronenburg, Boddington and Anchor Steam are among the brews available. The jukebox is a gem - everything from The Kinks to the Police, David Bowie and Tom Jones.  

No Country Karaoke on Mondays is a riot, and has one of the hugest song lists in town from which to choose.  They have also recently added a 1960s British mod dance night on Wednesdays.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Very excited to see what else the Chef will come up with once they get their full menu going.  With such limited seating and quality of food,  I can see this place as the next hot spot in town! 

We were there for the three course lunch.  First course was a chilled avocado soup.  I recommend spooning through all three layers to the bottom so you can taste the complexity of the soup.  Wonderful for the hot summer; refreshing and the perfect amount of salt and texture.  Second course was presented beautifully, the dusting of flavor of the shrimp was incredible - reminded me of a fresh shrimp ceviche.  The third course I chose the ramen.  I've had lots of ramen all over the place (in Asia as well as the states) and I've never tasted anything quite like this.  It was a wonderful porky broth with sesame and a charcoal-y, grilled flavor.  The meat is thicker than I like but was full of flavor and melted in my mouth.  My bowl of ramen seemed endless!  Couldn't finish everything....   

Similar to Raku and Kabuto in terms of food quality and service, but different in terms of type of food.  Raku to me is more traditional and Kabuto is strictly nigiri.  This place is like a modern twist on Japanese.  It's young and hip. 

We met Chef Omae after our meal and he is so humble and nice.  Very cool guy, definitely come check this place out!  Beat the crowds so you can say you've been there, tasted that.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The ice cream is excellent but a little pricey.  The service is less than stellar.  Our daughter bought a cone and discovered a hair in it.  When we returned to the counter and informed the employee that sold us the cone she actually said "We've been getting that a lot lately".  Great!

Also, if you order anything to be picked up later, like a birthday cake or cupcakes, make sure you call before you go to pick it up as they seem to be less than organized with their orders.

I gave them a 2 star rating based on the excellent flavors... it should have been at least a 4.5 with some attention to customer service.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>*shrug* it's ok. i think i was expecting better tasting fare because the folks i went with raved about the food. the restaurant itself looked charming with these quirky street signs tacked inside the restaurant. there was also a little nook for the bachelorette dinner that my friend had there. nice.

the food, however, not so much. one of the regulars in our party recommended the meat lasagna. i ordered that because i really dig lasagna too. entrees came with a choice of soup or salad. i opted for the salad and picked the creamy garlic dressing. oddly enough, that salad was the best part of the meal...oh, and the soft, yet crusty bread they served as you waited. mmmm...carbs.

my meat lasagna was too meaty and too cheesy, i know right? when are either of these two ingredients ever too much? in this situation, i dislked the fact that there was overwhelmingly more meat than the pasta itself. i felt like i was eating a chili bowl without the beans. the cheese was pretty funky too. it reminded me of a creamy brie cheese which i enjoy on crackers, but not in my pasta. the cheese made the lasagna altogether too mushy and again, there wasn't enough pasta to provide contrast in texture while eating it. overall, the lasagna portion was too big and just not yummy enough to warrant the fat grams that night.

a friend that sat right next to me ordered spaghetti and was able to get 1/2 an order of meatballs and a sausage. i think the kitchen staff just couldn't resist. 2 words: food porn. her entree came out with an erect sausage placed between two meatballs. i didn't know it was possible to get food THAT excited, but it was. i saw it coming and i thought, HOW APPROPRIATE for this bachelorette night.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Why go here when you can go to Blueberry Hill instead?  Don't waste your time with IHOP when there are other reasonably priced alternatives!  That being said, this place is very average... quite lackluster with all the run-of-the-mill choices you have come to expect from every other IHOP out there.  The service is spotty, as well.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Great food...a little pricey.  Basic pasta is about $16 and the meat dishes range from $20-35.  I had salmon...it was amazing!  When my boyfriend at the time and I ate there while it was still nice out, so we were able to sit outside and people watch.  Also, because they share owners, the acts that perform at the Majestic often eat there, so keep an I out for them. Check out my Majestic review for a good story about that!  Great food and lots of options, whatever you are in the mood for.  4 stars.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Well, Kevin A. pretty much summed it up in his review: new, clean, friendly and very good food! I meant to snap pics of my spicy (4/5, so good) basil chicken and whatnot, but I was too hungry. Mango sticky rice was addictive! They have a drive-thru and the menu says they deliver. Since I live really close, I walked and did takeout. Everything was cooked fresh and was ready to go within 10 minutes.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place wasn't exactly bad, but I still wouldn't say it's anything to tell your friends about. 

I was taken out for dinner here, and although the food was nice, 'nice' is about as excited as you could get about it, especially given the prices. I had a linguine dish, covered in what was essentially nothing more than tomatoes, garlic and chicken, but it still cost almost £11. Similarly, my dad's spaghetti with mussels in a white wine, cream and parsley sauce was nice but not exactly hugely original. 

Call me old fashioned, but to me an italian restaurant should have some degree of character or rustic charm to it. If not, it should be really good value, or at least something so tasty that it stands out from all its rivals. When it has none of these things, you can't help think that it's kind of a disappointment - no matter how trendy or 'George Street' it may be.

They have a blackboard outside announcing to the world that they do the best cupcakes and cocktails in the world. Whether or not that's true I don't know, what I do know is that their pizzas/pastas certainly aren't the best. Don't get me wrong, they're good, they're just nothing more than that.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I'm not sure if my expectation was too high but it was ok. 

Atmosphere: it's a fun environment with lot going on, however if your sitting by the corner window you'll need a pair of sunglasses or you'll be blind!

Food: large portions, I mean large so come hungry. Unfortunately, few items did come out little on the cold side. Must of been in waiting.. 2 star

Value: it's a good value considering its on the strip and the portions are large. 3 star

Service: good staff. Our server was really good all in all. 4 star

Overall, it's ok. There are some other eateries on the strip that serve similar food that are better. 3 star

Guy was here today! That's a plus!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Pros: consistent food. New and clean. Nothing tastes like the Whopper. Onion ring sauce. 

Cons: waited in the drive thru for 15 minutes at 530pm. Way too early for dinner time crowds, right? Not fast food! Why can't I stay away from Burger Kings? I always give them negative reviews for service.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Yes!  This place was soooo good.  Several veggie options... delicious Yakisoba.  I'm looking forward to trying out their sister-restaurant, Eastwind.

Went on a Saturday night and it was VERY busy.  I can't wait to go back, just not during peak hours.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Walking along state street on a beautiful sunny(and unseasonably warm) Wednesday, I had the pleasure of deciding between Vics and Clarys popcorn. I read the reviews and decided to try Clary's . Immediately upon entering, you could tell what set Clary's apart was the staff. Offering samples and delivering a surprisingly fresh product, the man behind the counter went above and beyond my expectations of this little popcorn shop on State St.

 I decided to go with butter, a little brewers yeast, and a spicy chili style seasoning. With a pop, candy for my son and a small tip I was out the door spending only $5!


I would recommend Clary's to everyone.. It takes me back to making popcorn with my mom and dad as a little kid.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Like fellow reviewers, I've never eaten Nepali food outside of here and its sister restaurant Chautara, I've had several amazing meals here. Simple fresh food in the traditionally laid-back State Street atmosphere. Everything I have had was good here. Great for vegetarians and those seeking a unique ethnic-fod experience.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The Apiary is tremendously charming, and delivers dishes of real quality. I sampled a delicious soup and hearty venison stew. Their wine list is really smart, too, with everything available by the glass. All fans of Three Birds, which is owned and run by the same people, will love this place. I look forward to our little Yelp outing there, in February :-)

Overall, we said: "The Apiary was hugely impressive. The assurance with which Three Birds has established itself has transferred across directly, allowing this place to hit the ground running. It feels like an integral part of the fabric of our richly-woven Edinburgh restaurant tapestry, already. I'd strongly recommend a visit."</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Though I made it late to the party (a little after 2 am) and all the fun shows I heard about were over, I thoroughly enjoyed my time here.

I had been hearing about this place for weeks, and being a speakeasy themed lounge lover, knew that I had to pay this place a visit. I raced over to the Mandalay via the walkways from the Luxor and walked about halfway thru the casino before I found a security guard who had heard of the place and turned me in the right direction. Turns out I had passed it, it's so discreet outside, nestled underneath the escalators connecting the two hotels, across from Criss Angel's magic shop.

The outside, as I mentioned, is pretty discreet, showing only a desk tucked in a corner in front of a gorgeous gilded mirror with a couple of bookcases and various other decor surrounding it and that famous white 20's car off to the side. I found a guy just outside and asked if it was still open. He said they were coming to a close but there were still some partiers inside, opened up a bookcase to reveal a door and a dimly lit hallway, and I was in.

Everything about the inside politely taps you on the shoulder, telling you you've been transported to a 20's era speakeasy and you don't want to go back. One walkway around the bar has a few black and whites taken during the time period while another surprises you with a small stage in the wall for a band, instruments set up with musicians or not. At the center lies the main stage, more long than wide, with what appeared to be a smaller bar down alongside it, slightly below stage level so as not to interfere with the acts, comfy chairs and tables lining the area. An upright piano sits discreetly off to the side of the stage, not too far from the DJ's booth, also nicely blending in with the decor. In the midst of all that raised in the center of the lounge is the main bar, a nice square fully stocked with the makings of their specialty cocktails and any other drink concoction you desire. 

Employees are  dressed as newsboys or corseted gals as they cheerfully and quickly take your drink orders. As they were winding down I was unsure if I'd be able to sample a cocktail, but as I hoovered on the bar, a friendly blonde brought me a menu and happily made me a drink, making suggestions when I asked. I ordered That Strange Rush, a delicious blueberry liquor mixture, that had me wishing I had arrived earlier for more. The bar area has many more tables and chairs, all elegant and comfy.

I roamed the place beverage in hand to check out the landscape and stumbled upon the cigar room, decorated with nice white couches and portraits, keeping with the 20s theme.

Everyone was very friendly and inviting, I never felt like I was intruding as I worried I might, coming in so late. The other party's seemed to be enjoying themselves as well, joint with the bartenders as if they were old friends while sipping their drinks.

I finished my drink and regretfully left, walking down an adjacent dimly lit hallway near the entrance and discovering I had walked thru a brick wall by the car.

I definitely want to come back again, this time for the shows!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>All right, I admit it - I don't drink alcohol. Period. But my younger brother got married about 2 weeks ago, and my father sent me on a "beer run" to get more beverages for the party. 

Being that this is (most likely) the closest liquor store to the house, I decided to come over here. The store itself is a bit large and overwhelming, and I asked for help when I couldn't find the products I had been sent for. 

Quite honestly, I was worried the staff in here weren't going to be friendly or helpful. I was wrong on both fronts. Within 2-3 minutes of telling them what I was looking for, I was at the register paying for it. I admit, it was a little pricey (given that the establishment has "discount" in its name), but I can't change the fact that alcohol is expensive stuff.

Additionally, after paying for my items, the gentleman who helped me find the stuff I was looking for helped us get the items out to my car, and even lifted them to load them in the back (this was a pretty big haul.) And he did it with a good personality and a smile on his face. 

I haven't been in liquor stores too often, and for obvious reasons that probably won't change anytime soon. But these guys deserve credit for doing a good job - enough said.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Really decent! The sushi is fresh and quite good for a buffet. I liked everything I put on my plate for the most part. I was a little disappointed that they use instant mashed potatoes....but whatever. Also, soda refills are NOT free and that came as a bit of a surprise when the bill came, seeing as how our server made no mention of this. Despite bad mashed potatoes and paying for soda refills, World Buffet was exactly what I expected and what I wanted on a night I couldn't bring myself to make dinner. I wouldn't come here for a nice night out, but it really did the trick tonight. We left full and happy, and I believe that even the pickiest eater could find something they enjoy.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>It took me a long time to eat here after hearing about it for years. It is so way out of the way for me. On the way home from a day trip up north I decided to stop by. Well, the restaurant was being renovated so they sent me to their newer location on 7th Street and Union Hills instead. ( even more out of my way) The service was amazing. Renee and staff were wonderful. However, with that said I did not think the food was all that great or matched the hype. I wonder if Pizza by the Slice is not the way to go here. My crust was burnt and hard to eat although the toppings were good. I did not like the Garlic Cheese bread very much and the sauce was bland. The Cannoli did not taste like Cannoli. Apparently, they make it different here. All in all I would not go back since it is very far away for me. My guess is their pasta dishes might be good since the place is so popular with a long wait every night.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Went there last Saturday.  Service very slow.  New food prep strategy not working.  After 3 inquiries I finally got a bagel that I ordered 50 minutes prior.  Even then it was not the bagel I ordered.  I know they are new but it was very apparent that the staff was poorly, if at all, trained.  Manager really needs help.  She was overwhelmed.  Will try again, but if service is as bad as my first visit I will not come again.  They should have left my Paradise Cafe open.  It was so much better and more inviting!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Amazing management staff! We went in on a Friday night and it was busy, so we took a high-top in the bar. We were greeted right away, but with the number of customers they had, it took awhile for our food to come out. The manager came over and asked us if we would like an appetizer or salads on the house and we declined (it didn't even feel like we'd be waiting a long time). The food came out about 5 minutes after the manager left and they brought us a free pizzookie at the end of our meal. 

Can't ask for better service! I love their deep dish pizza as well- dead on to Chicago-based places like Giordannos or Lou Malnottis :)</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Had been ordering from the Jamerica cart on Library Mall for some time, and finally tried the restaurant on Williamson.  Decor is eclectic--snapshot photos pasted on the wall, plastic tablecloths, beverage cooler in the dining area, but the food is the real reason for coming.

Run-down mango tofu with rice and vegetables is a great vegetarian option.  Jerk pork and chicken were savory and falling off the bone--the pork was tender and moist in comparison to the Library Mall cart, where the pork is sometimes a bit dry.  Servings are massive--each dish is easily two meals, so plan on taking half home for tomorrow's meal.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>If there's one thing that really annoys me about shop-bought sandwiches, it's the ridiculously mean amount of fillings they (don't) put in. I like my sandwiches gooey, and that's why I love this place.

There's no question that Uncle T's is an absolute winner. Yes, it's definitely more of a grab-and-go takeaway place than an actual café, but if I ever need to get lunch out and about this is always where I head first. It's just across the street from several other national sandwich chains, and even if you're normally the kind of person lured in to those places on the basis of the reassurance that you always know exactly what you're going to get, I challenge you to give this place a go. 

I guarantee you'll be converted. They have more fillings than you'd think it possible to fit in one chill counter - a good selection of both veggie and non-veggie - so you can create your perfect bespoke sandwich exactly to your taste. You can choose the type of bread it comes in, or whether or not it's toasted.

My one word of warning... take a bib. Preferably one of those ones with the scoop at the bottom.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Scantly Clad Waitress, Decent Hookah, and Great Menu 

Everywhere my hubby and I travel we always try a new hookah bar (we met at one). So why would Las Vegas be any different?

We were initially going to go to Luna Lounge on the strip (Thanksgiving night and they were closed) so we ended up at Hookah Masters Lounge (HML) which was a pleasant surprise.

Hookah and Server: I will say I was a little hesitant when we walked in an the server was prancing around in underwear but she was wonderful! Super friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable. My fiance is Arab and of course only smokes double-apple(no matter where we go) so of course this was different, but to our pleasant surprise they had Nakhala - which is what many traditional smokers use. The hookah wasn't ours (of course we think we have best at home) but it was good - the server was efficient at keeping hot coals on the hookah and consistently checking on us and each of the patrons...maybe her efficiency came from a lack of pants? Meh - she was was awesome. 

Atmosphere: and setup in a way that could accommodate several large groups of people. Being over the age of 18 we still decided to sit on that side of the establishment as it was more populated.  

Food: Although we didn't actually eat there we did receive a menu to look over and by reviewing it they have a great selection ranging from appetizers, sandwiches, and entrees. Hummus, Hummus w/Sherwma, Mozzarella Sticks (can't go wrong with fried cheese), Sherwma Sandwhichs (Beef and Chicken), and even platters Beef Kabob, Chicken Kabob, and Kafta Kabob... Just to name a few.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The chefs from the  Purslane (which is an excellent little nearby restaurant on St Stephen's St) have recently taken over the kitchen at The Anitquary. And it shows. Simple dishes, like roasts and casseroles, are served to a very high standard, making this a really good pub grub place. Sunday is an ideal time for a visit for a good quality roast.

Overall, we said: "I was very pleased with The Antiquary. The food was a cut above the regular pub grub fare and the setting very cosy. I could see myself regularly spending Sunday afternoons here, topping up my roast meat levels, playing a little spot of Monopoly and supping an ale or two, from their impressive selection."</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Teuchters is a great wee pub in the west end, with a brilliant, busy atmosphere and a faithful gaggle of regulars that never fail to turn up most evenings/weekends for a great deal of pint drinking and banter. I do recognise a lot of the same faces when I come in here, but I actually think that's a really good thing, because having a group of drinking attendees means that this place must be doing something right. A great selection of whisky and beers, and really friendly staff make this pub a good all rounder, and you can relax for a good few hours without worrying about the posing pressure imposed in some bars.

The restaurant attached to Teuchters, A Room In The West End, is also reliably very decent, serving quality Scottish produce in a down to earth setting. Prices are also reasonable, so you should have enough notes left over after you've paid the bill to go through to the bar and have a few after dinner drinks.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Primarily because of the deep dish pizza quality I'm giving Fuzzy's 4 stars.  Cheese is that high quality, rich milky mozzarella and it is accompanied by that extra tangy version of tomato sauce that is somewhat common in Chicago.  Deep dish crust was lightly crisped &amp; semi soft on the bottom, and the same at the end though much thicker.  Delicious chewy breadiness inside, and a golden brown crispy on the outside.  Light cornmeal dusted on the bottom.

I did not try the thin crust but the table adjacent to me had several, and they appeared much thicker than what I normally associate with Chicago thin crust (almost cracker thin).  I would describe it as a medium looking crust on a pizza that just happens to be cut into squares.

Toasted raviolis, fried mushrooms, fried mozz, wings, etc. round out the menu, and an assortment of soft drinks is available.  No beer from what I could see.  Prices were reasonable.

Chicago Cubs and other Chicago sports memorabilia decorate the walls to make you feel at home.   Extremely casual dining here - some folks with those sleeveless cut-off shirts (sorry, no mullets though!)

Location is on the West facing side of a strip mall that shoulders a grocery store there on Bell.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This was one of the first Mexican food places I tried when I first moved to AZ ten years ago.  Back then I knew nothing, now I see that I was lucky to have been taken somewhere that would really get me interested in trying more Mexican restaurants.

Well after about 8 years I went back last night and had it again and I was impressed.  The beans were a little bland but that is about the only complaint I have.  The salsas were fresh and delicious as was the tortilla on my fish burrito. I could have just eaten a couple of the tortillas with the salsa.   My boyfriend got three hard shell beef tacos and it was only $3.49 and it came with chips. So not only was it tasty, it was cheap.  It is close to the freeway so even though I don't live very close I will be going back soon.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I hate to give a 1-star review, but Manuel's earned it. Having lived in Albuquerque for six years, I know how a chile relleno should look when it arrives at the table. Manuel's batter was heavy on the egg and what we found on the plate was, unfortunately, an omelet with green chile. Disgusting.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Snagged some takeout last week and was impressed enough to give it another try! 

The location seems doomed, for the year and a half I've lived in the neighborhood there's never anybody inside. Though the staff was a lot nicer than I recall when it was Wong's. 

Prices are a bit high in my opinion given that the quality of the food isn't great. But it's a nice alternative to China Wok on Fordem if you're looking for something fast to pick up.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Now, I can think of several places in town that serve amazing pizza - La Grande, and Pizzeria Bianco come immediately to mind.  But Pizza Heaven gets 4 stars for other reasons.  It's cheap, tasty no-frills kind of pizza , with something for everyone.  

The pizza itself is thin crust with a nice crispy, yet doughy taste.  The ham, cheese (very good cheese, btw) and mushrooms I had on pizza tasted fresh and the toppings were generous.  

Something that sets it apart is the wide variety of toppings and the restaurant's perceived desire to offer something for everyone.  The menu includes more than 20 veggie toppings, lowfat cheese and soy cheese upon request - something you don't find much of at a pizza joint - much less the fancy pizza palaces of Phoenix!  

The decor inside is very simple - chairs and tables - no booths.  They had the basketball game on TV in the background, and even have a live band on Friday and Saturday night - not sure on the type of music.  Give them a call to find out.   They serve the normal selection of pizza, pasta, subs and salads and even have a limited offering of beer and wine for the tipplers out there...

BTW: The location is new - having relocated up the road to bigger digs (now at 5150 N 7th St. betw. Camelback and Missouri).</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I went here to try the lunch buffet last Saturday and was impressed.I have been a regular at Maharaja for years, but I might now be an even bigger fan of this Indian restaurant.
The lunch buffet has a lot of great offerings.Though the space around the buffet is crowded and could be opened up more, the buffet items were delicious.
I had an amazing eggplant dish, the Tikki masala was so good (even better than Maharajas) and they give you a choice of regular Nan or coconut Nan. The coconut nan is out of this world! Their tandoori chicken was nice and tender and not too dry, also an excellent dish. I also tried their rice pudding and Mango Lassi which were both excellent.
I think being a newer restaurant there are a couple of kinks to be ironed out like making sure the buffet has enough plates and bowls available.The staff was friendly which we appreciated.
Maharaja upped their buffet prices on the weekend which I think was not their best move and not only is this place more affordable but I think has better food overall.I will be back :-)</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Had an okay stay here at this Marriott (which looks to have been an Embassy Suites at one time, judging by the interior).  I was traveling on business, and appreciated the quiet rooms and very comfy bed.  

Some of the interior could use some updates, especially in the bathroom.  One major annoyance was that the blackout drapes were for decoration only and couldn't be closed all the way to make the room dark.  What a pain!!

Other than that, friendly staff and mediocre breakfast in the morning.  There really isn't anything around of note (all chain restaurants and office buildings), so I think on my next trip I'll drive a little extra to stay in Madison and bypass Middleton!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The Broiler is located inside Boulder Station Hotel &amp; Casino.

My favorite inexpensive steakhouse in Vegas. It's on the opposite side of town but totally worth the drive.

They start you out with a basket of fresh baked breads. Save me one of the fresh soft baked pretzels!!!

Recommended entrees: Filet Mignon, King Crab Legs, Lobster Tail, Panko Crusted Shrimp. (You can order a filet then add any of the other items at a reasonable price.) Dinners include one family style side dish from at least a dozen choices. The baked potato is huge. Their creamed spinach is delicious. The sauteed mushrooms are heavenly.

The soup and salad bar has Just about anything you could imagine or want on a salad bar is there. Love the chilled asparagus. The tuna salad is tasty. Just don't fill up on the salad bar because there's a great meal coming!!!

Service is always outstanding. The staff is professional and attentive.

Looking forward to my next trip to Vegas for a stop at The Broiler.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>What a romantic little Italian place next to the Wisconsin State Capitol.   A friendly staff and a beautiful ambience contributed to one of the most romantic meals I've ever had.  The food was tasty, the portions generous, and the recipes were amazing.  A wonderful venue, this is quite a nice place to bid Arrivederci to pretty Madison.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I wasn't 100% convinced upon my first visit to Deli Fresco. Despite enjoying my lunch there, the constant dulcit tones of Frank Sinatra blaring away in the background grated a bit. I'm as partial to a bit of Ol' Blue Eyes as the next man, but not quite at that ear-crushing volume.

With the volume thankfully turned down, yesterday's visit was exceptionally enjoyable. The food is the usual baguettes, paninis, soups and salads, but is all very well done, very well priced, and even dished up on a nice shiny plate.

Unlike many lunch stops, it's a comfortable and quiet enough place to sit in as well. If you find yourself round about this area and the hunger pangs start, I'd recommend it with full vigour.</review:review_text>

Chocolate Chip

The latest roll-out in the reinvention of The Monte Carlo, and aside from Yusho the most interesting by far, BLVD Creamery opened with little fanfare but with elegant ice creams, sorbets, and baked goods made in house daily one can only hope artisan ice cream is the new 'celebrity burger' of The Strip.  Large in both size and selection with high ceilings and kitschy cow décor plus a youthful staff already well trained it was just after 1pm that I entered the new BLVD and bearing no relationship to the cocktail bar in The Linq my experience started out with a tasting - no two-spoon limit like that of Sprinkles either, just a smiling face with recommendations comprising nearly half the selections and none but the overly-subtle tres leches less than impressive.  Silky in texture and close to gelato in heft with large single-scoops starting at $4 it was eventually on the horchata-esque rice pudding that I settled and served in a fresh baked compressed-cookie bowl without accoutrements I can confidently say Art of Flavors finally has some creamy frozen competition - a bit of oneupsmanship from the newcomer, even, in the form of two warm cookies on par with the best of Las Vegas Boulevard.  Similarly priced to AoF as well as Sprinkles with a patio adjacent to the new Sambalatte one can only hope that BLVD spurs the same sort of creativity and competition in frozen treats that Due Forni and Settebello brought to reinvent the Las Vegas pizza scene over the last ten years because in a city of two-million with triple digit temperatures and tons of tourists there is a whole lot of space between Monte Carlo and Chef Desyree's spot up north for something cold and creamy.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>For eleven months of the year this place is one of the Edinburgh Uni's Student Unions, but during the Festival in August it's a really popular and well-used venue for comedy and music shows.

It's a small venue, I'd say it seats around 20-30 with more room for a standing at the back, so if you're going to see a show here you should get there early! That said, the reason I gave it 3 stars and not 4 is how cramped it is. Even if you do get there early enough to be far enough forward in the queue for a seat, if you're bigger than the average hobbit you'll struggle with the lack of leg room. 

And this is also where being small is a disadvantage - although you get much more intimate performances here, it'll also be 30oC and really smelly by the time the interval comes around.

Which is just as well - there's a bar adjoining the theatre so you can cool down with something cold and alcoholic, and not even have to walk more than a few metres for the privilege. If that bar is full, during the Fringe there's always a beer garden set up in the courtyard outside which is a gorgeous suntrap during August.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Gotta love Food City's.   The fruit and produce section is amazing and so cheap it's "almost free".    Any time I need a lot of veggies for a recipe or cooking some big meal this is the place to come.

Fresh tortillas and Mexican pastries made on site all very good. 

Every weekend they have fresh roasted chilies for sale, yum.

I'm not into their meat selection, don't know why just doesn't appeal to me.

They have all the basics but you won't find much in the way of the "low fat" or "fat free" items here.

The ranchera music is WAY to loud, even for me, and I get a few odd looks like "hey what is this gringo doing in our store" but it's totally worth checking out.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I had a nice experience here. I got vegan chocolate ice cream and a marshmallow on top (both tasted amazing). The workers were very friendly. The only bad thing about this place I would say is that they are a bit overpriced (and they were out of whipped cream, but I will overlook that).</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The pseudo-hubster LOVES this place and drags me along every once and again. The salsas, I think, suck, so that's a big time star auto-deduct. It's pretty dumpy inside and out, and it's almost always dead... this is pretty much the entire reason I like it. We can come here without seeing a soul we know, enjoy some good, traditional Mexican food, and enjoy a cerveza in peace.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I don't go to Moto very often, even though it's across the street from my  house.  I've really only been for dinner and take out.  It's been good, standard fare.  Nothing spectacular, but good.  The fish has been better than some places.  And the AYCE sushi special on Saturdays for $15.95 is a great deal.

Today I went to lunch with a PG girlfriend, so, no raw fish for her.  We decided to share two dishes, the sweet &amp; sour shrimp and the veggie pad thai.  While the serving of pad thai was huge, I thought that $8.95 for no meat was a little steep, it's $12.95 to add chicken, beef, shrimp or tofu.  And the shrimp bowl was good, the sauce was tasty and not too sweet, but only 5 pieces of shrimp.  Not a value.

Since they don't have a lunch menu, I think I'll stick to Moto for happy hour and for dinner and AYCE on Saturdays.</review:review_text>

With dog in tow, we went to pick up the requisite food and supplies.  Mounds is the place to go. Locally owned and operated, the staff are friendly and knowledgeable and they give you a Mounds candy bar upon check-out.  Love it.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Not bad. Picture menu above cash register helps. "Sandwiches" (they're more of what you would consider a wrap) are $6-$10, while plates are about $10. Plenty of Mediterranean options to choose from: kebabs, kaftas, schwarma, falafel, even American staples like cheeseburgers. The portions are more than generous, prepare to take leftovers home. The beef kebab wrap had giant chunks of well-seasoned meat that was a little on the chewy side. Fries that come with the "sandwiches" are well seasoned and perfectly crisp. Although service is a little slow, and sometimes the waitstaff don't know where the food is going to (maybe giant numbers handed out with every order would help?), I would definitely go back.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Mo' Burger is a casual fast style burger join located in the Arizona Mills food court, operated by Villa Enterprises (Villa Pizza). Since beer (tap &amp; bottles) and wine are served here, there is a shared dedicated self serve seating area for Mo' Burger and Villa Italian Kitchen customers, no alcoholic drinks can leave this area. There is also counter seating with two flat screen TVs above the kitchen area window.

The menu offerings include single, double &amp; triple hamburgers and cheeseburgers (American, cheddar, pepperjack or Swiss) served on choice of potato or everything bun, fresh cut fries, onion rings, wings, fried portobello mushrooms, nachos, Pepsi fountain drinks, (self serve), and desserts (frozen custard, piecretes (pie slices with frozen custard), shakes). The burgers are made with fresh not frozen certified angus beef. This burger place sort of reminds me of the Union Burger chain, locations mostly in Ontario, Canada, though that chain also offers chicken sandwiches and veggie burgers.

While shopping at Arizona Mills, I stopped for a lunch break in the food court. I decided on Mo' Burger. I ordered a single burger ($3.65) on an everything bun (onion, sesame, poppyseed) topped with lettuce, tomato, pickles, fried onion straws, &amp; chipotle ketchup (no charge for those toppings) and I also made a combo (add $3.19) with fries and med fountain drink. The food was prepared to order and ready in about 7 minutes.

The food I had was quite good. The single burger patty was cooked well done (slight dry), which the fresh flavors of the beef and toppings and soft chewy bun went well together. The shoestring fresh cut fries were crisp and a bit greasy. Overall, a pretty good burger lunch in a food court.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I was afraid that the food here would taste a little too healthy, but I was so wrong. It is decadence without the guilt! There is so much variety to the menu too. I recommend trying the oatmeal cold in yogurt or warm with Coconut oil.  The coconut oil will literally make you feel weak in the knees, it is that good.
The decor is like a micro brewery/shabby chic country store. Which doesn't sound like it goes together, but it does and it looks great. It's a really relaxed atmosphere and is the perfect place to meet friends for brunch!
If the food wasn't already good enough you should go to this place just to see the Robert Downy Jr. look alike that works behind the counter! Seriously though, Sam and Melissa were great hosts every time I've been there. Very friendly and knowledgeable.  Melissa seems like the kind of gal that would go out of her way to help a perfect stranger,  and it really shows in the way she runs this family business.
You won't regret trying this really original take on how to eat oatmeal.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We found this restaurant on a recent trip with 'Yelp', this is the best locally owned restaurant we found in 2500 miles.  Don't waste your time going to a chain, you will not be disappointed with these guys. The owners (3rd generation) were great and the food was excellent. The couple in the booth next to us had been coming for 30 years.  When I'm through this area again, its the place for us.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I did not expect what we got from this place! Having lived in Reno and Vegas for almost 13 years, I know that locals casinos can have good places, but it's best to keep expectations low and be pleasantly surprised by the great ones. This is a GREAT ONE!

We stopped in for dinner after a movie. We were the last ones in before they closed the kitchen, and for that we were thankful. We were all out grateful that they never once made us feel rushed.

We skipped appetizers, as we had had popcorn at the movie. My hubby ordered the fettuccine alfredo, and I had the veal francese. The alfredo sauce was fantastic. There's not much in it but cream and cheese and it's done well. Extremely rich. The lemon sauce on the veal was out of this world. Perfectly balanced lemony but not sour and buttery and herby. The kitchen was out of mashed potatoes, which is the typical side for te dish. The waitress and I discussed it and I got angel hair with more of the lemon sauce. It was just the right substitution, and I will order it that way on purpose in the future!

The big winner of the night was the tiramisu. Chef Dianna has something REALLY special there. It was heavenly perfection with just all the right stuff. We will be back for more!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>this is my favorite music venue in phoenix. it is a smaller venue best for local or indie bands, but every show i've been to their has been far more memorable then any show i've been to in phoenix.

the place itself isn't too stunning, it is just a rectangular brick building with a bar area on the right when you walk in, booths on the left side of the wall, some high tables in the middle, a stage and standing area at the back, and an eclectic mix of art on the walls. however, the place has a really good feel to it and excellent sound that leads to really wild and memorable concerts.

the two that i remember the most were the presets/the rapture and spinto band/art brut/we are scientists. i thought the presets were pretty lousy until i saw them play there and the rapture played an absolutely amazing set that lasted almost 2 hours and inspired an epic, comfortably out-of control dance party. the other show was equally long and boisterous, highlighted by eddie argos coming out into the crowd to sing 3 songs.

the bad things about the place are that last time i went there was still no alcohol because they lost their liquor license. however, i heard that they have got it back now, but i'm not sure. the shows i went to i had to go down the street between sets and drink at alice cooperstown which isn't cheap. 

it also doesn't have a patio at all where you can hang out and hear the music or what is going on inside and drink or smoke. the venue reminds me alot of the lounge in the back of Plush in tucson except for the lack of a patio which is really important in a state like AZ where the weather is so good at night most of the year.

of course the worst thing is just the lack of bands that go there. most bands come to either marquee (heaven help us poor phoenicians) or even worse, the clubhouse. if you happen to be a tour manager reading reviews on yelp, please book your band at the brickhouse.

Update - 8/31 - Had to downgrade to 4 stars after my most recent visit. Its hard to believe that I'm downgrading them now that they have liquor available, but it's happening. 

They normally have local draft brews at this place for 2 dollars, but apparently when they have a show they don't sell it at all. Only bottles for 3 or 4 dollars. What's worse is that every bottle I ordered wasn't cold, tasted like they just threw it in the ice bin 30 minutes before. AND they kept running out of beers. What's even worse is that the mixed drinks run 6 DOLLARS for a really tiny glass. This place needs to get its act together. I'll be drinking beforehand and elsewhere in between sets from now on. I don't get why the music venues in Phoenix don't understand how much more money they can make at a show with drink specials.

They also apparently haven't invested in air conditioning which makes summer shows not even worth it. Okkervil River still put on a great show to my surprise, which is the only thing (along with the other great shows i've seen there) that kept me downgrading this place to 3 stars or lower.

They are also in the middle of remodeling so the place looks kindof like crap right now.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Oh, Tags.
I lived around the block, and hot damn, I wasted so much money here on god knows what. Probably just candy, chips, pop and gatorade. 
But so did all the other frat guys and sorority girls, so I feel okay.
Corned beef sandwiches, mmmm.

    <review:review_text>Nice family place with limited operational hours (evenings on Friday, Saturday, Sunday only). Chicago theme on the inside is cozy, with plenty of Bears, Bulls, &amp; Cubs posters. Very modest atmosphere, perhaps dated, but cozy nonetheless and a place that is suitable for bring the entire family. Seems to be a small, local family-owned business as well.

Thin crust is like a thick cracker - flour bottom, crispy, yet still somewhat chewy. Sweet &amp; tangy tomato sauce seems to draw people as well, as many of us from Illinois are familiar with the thin crust &amp; extra sweet tangy sauce formula for pizza.

As of winter 2008, the menu consisted of pizza, a calzone like "pizzoli", and salads. No subs, eggplant, chicken, etc. that is mentioned in the Web Review.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I was all set to write a review of this Friday afternoon and give it two stars, but Friday night, after the ball game, we headed up there.  Somewhere in between the good conversation, loud-but-not-too-loud bar noise and more than a few drinks I had a great time.  The trappings (flags, showy beer taps, etc) ring a bit false to me, but I am, after all, an Irishman treading in dangerous territory.  

Drinks are stiff and relatively cheap.  There's usually always a free table to sit at and the clientele is varied and friendly.  Not the best of CenPho but not the worst, either.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I''ve long been a fan of Qdoba, and never really gave Chipotle a second look. But once I finally tried them, I was hooked. Their burritos are both more flavorful AND more affordable, plus they use meat from organically raised animals. Their selection is a little more basic and they close at 11, so every once in awhile I still hit Qdoba if I'm in the mood for a "signature" burrito or if I'm out late, but if you just want a good burrito at a good price, Chipotle is the place to go!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I had the Char-Broiled Italian Sausage which was really good. Fries were very just fine. The chili is really tasty. The combo is super good. Open and airy atmosphere, very enjoyable. We will return for sure.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Didn't know this was a gay bar when my girlfriend and I walked in. That won't sway my review, especially since we had just left Roscoe's prior to coming here. 

What will sway my review is the level of awkwardness. The transvestite sitting at the bar with his/her legs wide open showing the world the junk under the skirt. The 5 toothed cuban guy eating beef jerky, playing pool, and copping as many tranny feels as he could. The scary trip to the bathroom that could have resulted in a scary time for me because two guys were standing waiting for the urinal right behind me... not like off to the corner of the bathroom, or even outside the bathroom, but RIGHT BEHIND ME. 

Yeah, the awkwardness made this place weird. I always thought it was just a neighborhood alcoholic bar, but that it definitely is not. It seemed like a place for trannies, tranny chasers, weirdos, and locals (like myself and my girlfriend) who don't know any better.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I drive by Rosita's all the time-- and have never stopeed to go in... until 2 days ago and I am so glad I did.  It looks really tiny from McDowell but actually it is a pretty decent size.  I ordered the good ol standby: beef taco and cheese enchilada and rice.  I was very pleased with my meal.  It was affordable and tasty.  I will go back again.  The only drawback is the pond inside-- things like that skeeve me out. Service was normal, food came quickly (like most Mexican food places) and the chips were good- warm when delivered and the salsa was great!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Called today to place a large order to send to a local business as a thank you for helping us out.  Spoke to Jeff who worked out an AMAZING deal with us for a group of pizzas. Then after he got my card number, he discounted it some more.  Excellent customer service and price.  The pizza was enjoyed by everyone!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Good food, but some of the WORST service I have ever had at a fast-food restaurant!

Popeyes is a chicken franchise that has been around for several decades now. Recently, the chain opened up several more stores in the Vegas Valley. After coming to this particular store on more than a few occasions, I can safely say that probably wasn't a good thing.

What is it with fast food restaurants hiring idiotic staff? They have screwed up my order numerous times (I order a chicken nuggets kids meal and get home and find a DRUMSTICK in there instead!?) The staff are utterly clueless, and half the time they don't know the answers to the questions you ask them.

One time the person ringing my transaction had the audacity to say "have a nice day" as if dismissing me, BEFORE GIVING ME MY DRINKS AND CHEESECAKE. 

Expect to repeat your order several times, because they don't listen the first time. 

Go here if you like the franchise and their food, but go at your own risk, and double-check your order when you get it.

Food: B-
Service: D-</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Ditto to everyone else's comments thus far.

We dropped in for a drink the other night and were very pleasantly surprised with how hidden and cool the underground bar was. They also have Chimay on tap??? That's hard to mess with. 

We had already eaten a big dinner so we didn't go there but even a cursory glance at the menu left me inspired to come back soon. And I'm sure their cuisine won't fall far from the Richardson's tree, which is a very good thing, in my book.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The food is modestly priced and I was impressed. Our waitress was very nice and told us our specials. I went with the angel hair with shrimp and it came with a whole bunch of shrimp. Usually you order something like that and it comes with a few shrimp, but I was shocked at how much came on my dish.

If I live here ever again I would go back again and again, it's an upscale feel but the prices are very low and the food is delicious.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>all and all not a bad place...   Like the other reviews... it does not win points for decor... but what it lacks here it more than makes up for in service... i go here for lunch from time to time and they always seems to be quick... i really like it when they serve you chips and salsa and they bring out some sort of mexican soup...

the food is good... i like the shredded beef tacos and the burros are typical south side... HUGE with alot of good stuff in them... while this is not my favorite place in the area... it is still pretty good and is pretty authintic...</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The name describes it exactly a saloon &amp; dance hall. Grimy without presence. People actually dance!

A great place to go when your in sneakers and ready to throw back some shots &amp; beer.

Very Very country without apology none of that urban cowboy crap here. 

Super fun if you know what to expect.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Terrible coffee.  So bitter I would have to dump a quarter cup of cream and several heaping tablespoons of sugar into this cup-a-joe to overpower the flavor...  but at that point, why wouldn't I go all out and find myself a milkshake or some other creamy sugary treat?  

The muffins are the size of your head.  Lots of calorie-laden treats.  I had some carrot cake once and it had that stale refrigerator flavor in the icing.  What a waste. 

My advice, walk across the street to Starbucks. At least you'll get a mediocre cup of coffee instead of a bad one.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>OK people. Let's face it. If it was called Cleveland Market, nobody would go. But throw in a trendy city's name and "Oh, it must be fantastic." After all Boston does have the Celtics. And they gave us Kristin and Jared. But can they pull off fast food. Yea, kinda sorta. It's nice to have a fast food option that is a "square meal." No burgers or fries. Roasted chicken, that holiday green bean casserole everyone loves but is too afraid to admit they eat it, mashed taters (gravy sucks ass though)...all pretty descent. We even tried the sirloin there, cooked medium rare, but WOW, it was like $12! So, I'm sure it's not even a Boston based company. And we all know it's nothing like a market. But three stars for dependable, un-bunned food! Oh. The cornbread? Seriously, it's "crack" good. I'd knock over school children just to get an extra one. As they say in Boston, "cheers." I know. Lame. Now, go get some cornbread!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Strolling back to our hotel after a long, hot day, we were instantly drawn to the brightly colored, churning juice mixers. Then I saw the words "fresh cocktails" and I was sold. Squeeze has quite the extensive menu and alcohol can be added to any of their drinks. There are healthy juice fusions, smoothies, and classic fresh cocktails with a twist.

Squeeze is just about a week old and they're off to a great start. We tried some of their fresh cocktails and all were delicious. Fresh fruit is mixed into the drink and I loved sipping up little pieces of raspberry while savoring the Morning-After Mojito. The orange juice in the Ultimate Screwdriver was clearly squeezed from perfectly ripe and sweet oranges. I came back a second time to try their juice fusions and asked for the bartender's favorite. I liked the fresh cocktails better, but if you like watermelon juice, give the Blueberry Faux-Jito a try. The watermelon juice and mint overpowered the blueberry.

The bartenders were really friendly and for a juice bar, Squeeze scores high for taste and freshness. The second time, there was a line (about 6 people) and it took quite a while to make the drinks. Maybe one more bartender would help speed up these juice concoctions. Overall, it's a fabulous and refreshing pit stop on the strip.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Definitely Meh I've experienced better- especially in a culinary city like Edinburgh! With as much hype as this place has been getting recently I was hoping for a yummy lunch and a new favourite place to adopt. Plus their appealing lunch deals meant that a visit was in order and very soon, so when my mum came up for a visit I thought it would be an ideal treat.

I'll skip to the important stuff:
- potatoes with my main (pork) were hard in the middle- not cooked at all.
-slow cooked pork: over cooked and hard (far away from melt-in-your mouth goodness I was hoping for).
-My mum's fish main was OK, OK being that it was good but nothing really to write home about.
-the desserts, walnut tart and coffee ice cream and chocolate parfait with marshmallows and raspberries were a bit disappointing. There was nothing exactly wrong with them, the chocolate was too heavy (never thought I would say that about chocolate) and the walnut tart was mediocre. 
-plus be careful if you are going for the appealing lunch menu deals cause the various add ons tend to add enough on the bill).

All in all if it wasn't for it's hype it would be an alright restaurant, sort of at the medium level of all the other restaurants this city has. It wasn't packed, the view is from the front windows and the staff were alright. Didn't really get the feel of a rustic french food place and I have a feeling the publicity was a bit damaging to their quality. Perhaps they were having a bad day or something. I would like to try their other restaurant in New Town but I would not rush back to this one any time soon.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We stumbled upon Clarinda's Cafe on the way to the Palace of Holyroodhouse. It is a very cute teahouse on the Royal Mile. 

This place is perfect for a quick lunch or afternoon tea. We had sandwiches with salad and chips on the side. They also had an assortment of fresh baked cakes and pastries.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Had not been to the Broiler for years. We used to make this place a stop for dinner when we were LV tourist. Noticed a commercial for a prime rib special( $14.99) and it jogged our memory and we jogged.....well not exactly.....we drove over for a very nice meal at a great price. We did the 14oz prime rib special that came with their above average salad bar, mashed potatoes, broccoli and a basket of bread. I also had a very nice flight of wines for the bargain price of $10. Overall prices were very reasonable and the sides were only $5. which is a bargain for a LV steakhouse. A terrific restaurant with a nice soft ambience at a decent price. Will def put this place on our steakhouse rotation though it is a jaunt from Summerlin. Def worth the drive.So ono.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Great service, very enjoyable atmosphere and amazing food! 
We went right at 5 o'clock and sat at the hibachi. We were very pleased that they allowed us to go ahead and have hibachi even though it was just 2 of us. Our chef, Joe, was super fun and nice. 
Will definitely being returning!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I've been to many barber shops around Phoenix and have uncovered an odd trend.  A majority of the shops are owned by Jewish Uzbek's.  
What do Uzbekistan and traditional barber shops have in common?  I have no idea.  But its strange, don't you think? 

When I first began to notice the trend, I would go to a new barber to see if  they too were from Uzbekistan.  I'd hear that accent and ask, "You from Uzbekistan?"  "Yes", would almost always be the reply.  Oddly, they wouldn't question how I knew this.  

If the Soviet Union were still around I'd be really worried.  I even found an Uzbek during a RARE visit to Supercuts!   Her husband who is also an Uzbek' works at the New York barber on Indian School @ 24th St!  I can name six other Uzbek barber shops in town!

It must be a cultural thing I'm assuming, but I've noticed most of the Uzbek barbers are not really friendly.  They don't seem to smile or be chatty.  Probably a by-product of the communist economy?  

That's not usually the case at Central Barber though.  They've learned those social niceties that most Americans take for granted and expect.    Always warm and welcoming and just the right amount of chit-chat.  

One of the best things about this shop is the built-in vacuum that's attached to the electric clippers.  This greatly reduces the amount of hair left behind.  They also clean you up with a warm towel and give this great neck massage at the end of your cut.  Although the warm towel thing really sucks in the middle of the summer.  

Not sure about all of the barbers, but the owner Roman and Abraham give the best cuts.  No appointments, but the wait is usually no more than 20 minutes max.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>My husband and I were most definately pleasantly suprised! We were so tired and starving and we were staying at arizona charlies so we didn't want to go anywhere far away. We were nervous about eating here and it was Saturday night and no line so we thought for sure we were in for it. The casheir was the nicest lady on the planet and she gave us a big fat discount!
The food was amazing, everything was delicious. Nothing was old or cold or weird and the salad bar did not taste like the lettuce came out of a bag. Which makes me super happy! And our server was awsome! Everyone here was friendly and pleasant and for a buffet it was decorated kinda classy! It was so good we went back again tonight! And for the price I think it was one of the best buffets I have eaten at in a very long time.  :)  very pleased.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The desserts must be good because the sandwiches are very disappointing. I really want to like this place but I've eaten there twice and was not impressed. If you like cheap meat, bland flavor, and lots of mayo on your sandwich this is your kind of place.   I hate to be so negative but it's just not my kind of food I guess. My wife had the same impression.  Those of you who love this place .... please tell me why??</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Looking for a place with real grass in Las Vegas? Well this is it! 

Located just outside the food court of Plaza Hotel, this patch of grass is equipped with picnic tables, live music and great seats for people watching. The selection of beer includes the all time favorites but also some interesting must-trys like the Coconut Curry or Banana Bread beer! While you are there, don't forget to order a pretzel. Comes with two different (delicious) dipping sauces and the pretzel is bigger than the plate. 

Definitely a great place to hang out and relax with good company.</review:review_text>

Not only do they always forget something, but half the menu will take "another 16 minutes" according to the drive up attendant.

    <review:review_text>This is by far one best McDonalds I've ever been to!

French Fries are always fresh &amp; HOT, drive through is always fast, special orders are completed by the time I get to the final window, and the most important thing - my order is always correct when I get home or to the office.

Drive through is open 24 hours for those late night cravings.

They even have a charging station for your electric vehicle and a large indoor playground for the kids.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Mi Cocina is my favorite Mexican-style restaurant in the Madison area.  I have never come away unimpressed with either the food or the service.  I can't really speak to authenticity since I wouldn't really know it if I saw it, but for what they do Mi Cocina does it well.  All I do know is that I have gotten my favorites here over and over without ever having any problems.  The staff is always friendly and fast which sets the place apart from several other area restaurants of the genre.  If only for consistency I would rate Mi Cocina a three, and with never having a bad meal I definitely would go with a high 3.5 - 4 stars.

Last time I had the fried tilapia tacos, and I especially enjoyed the spicy cream-based sauce that was served on the side.  It was perfectly seasoned for my taste, though it was a bit hot for my mother.  The tilapia was lightly fried and was still tender.  The accompanying refried beans were decent, and served to allow for the spice from the tacos to dissipate.  I still put the blackened tilapia tacos at Tex Tubbs at the top of my favorites list, but these easily jumped to the #2 position.  On previous trips I've gotten flautas, which were perfectly fried and not too crispy, and the enchiladas sonora, which comes with an excellent spinach and a creamy sauce.  I also really enjoy the cheese and mushroom quesidilla and the fajitas.  My sister, who is lactose-intolerant, had found the menu a bit dairy-laden, but she did end up finding a chicken breast entree that is now her favorite.  The prices are quite reasonable and given the amount of food always a good deal.  Mi Cocina probably won't ever be held up as a paragon of the style, but it has always been reliable and enjoyable and for that I'll keep coming back.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Eh.  This is the second Fatburger I have been to, as I usually like to give mediocre a second try in case it was a fluke.  Nope, sorry Fatburger- you are just bland.  The burger was lacking excitement.  Bland was the theme of the day here.  The prices were way out of line for the end product.  Oh well.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Noticed this place was open the other day and thought I would give it a try . . . especially since I was in the mood for some Chinese food.

Being new . . . the place was clean . . . and unlike a lot of other restaurants . . . you can actually see the entire kitchen while they are preparing you food.  The food . . . I ordered of the lunch menu . . . I got mine to take out . . . and it was still hot and delicious when I got back to the office.

Here is my problem . . . and the reason they lost a star . . . if you dine in with the lunch menu, you get soup and fried won ton . . . if you get the meal to take out . . . no soup or won tons . . . I guess next time I will have to try dining in.

And yes . . . there will definitely be another trip . . .</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>What a delightfully friendly couple that own this place. I'm not going to talk about Blimpie's food quality, you all know what they have and what it tastes like. The owners, however, are very nice people that like to converse with their regulars and treat everyone like they are a friend. 

If you're looking for fast food in this area, you should try this Blimpie over Taco Bell, KFC, etc.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Fuzzy's serves up Chicago-style thin crust pizza, and does it well. I've hit them up for a pie a couple of times now, and have been super-pleased. The crust is light and crisp, the sauce is nice and tomatoey, and the amount and quality of toppings just right.

My only issue is that sometimes they are a bit slow. I rationalize this by assuming that they are making my pizza fresh, and that takes a little time.

Also, the wings are pretty tasty too. There were lots of drummies in the mix, and I like that.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place is both a buffet and a takeout restaurant. For take out, it's great. As a buffet, it's okay. The food is always fresh and the buffet is refreshed constantly so nothing sits out very long. It's nothing fancy, but it's good. Not great. But good. It's a favorite for take out while living out in the boonies!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Although this retail location appears to be stocked with merchandise, the staff seems disinterested in helping. They would prefer to assist clientele who are on the thinner / fitter/ younger side of life. Anything else they really don't have the attention span for.

As witnessed on multiple visits.

[Head Shake]

Before I dropped a chunk of mass I ventured into this store. I would have spent the world and the moon that day. (The mgr of sales in training at my gym had sent me over to "invest" in protein what not.) I had a very specific product to purchase and a list of other "maybes".

Yeah, this is before I started eating clean. Anyway, I had some questions. But the same very tall, dark haired lad, had to help a gal. With her cell phone. And then with mints. And some other critical stuff.

I get it. Flirting. Sure, on the job. Go forth, do that.

But when I finally had his attention, he had the audacity to be annoyed. At the actual paying customer. (vs. the gal that works next door and pops in all the time.)

Hoy Vey. Kids. I get 'ya. 
But help the old ones with their wallets wide open next time.

Periodically I would stop in there on my way to Sports Authority. To buy some energy bars. SAME THING.

Then I changed my food vocabulary and never, ever, needed to go in there.

DON'T GO.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Were told to take table at the end of the patio. No one came to ask about drinks or anything until I came to front 10 min later and asked if anyone would serve us.  It serves Mexican food but there is no complimentary chips. Overall wait time was more than 45 minutes. Really? For chicken fajitas and tortilla soup?! And they were not busy. The size of the portions not adequate for the price. You are paying for being in the heart of Scottsdale.   And the morale is - don't forget to read Yelp before going anywhere. Everything people said before about the business appeared right!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Noon and I'm starving! 

hadn't eaten since the night before... i could feel my stomach slowly eating itself! after picking up some stuff on my way back to work i saw Blimpies... as usual... seen it a million times but never stopped in. 

there were a few folks inside... looked cozy enough.. 

the lady behind the counter wasn't very social... just what do you want.. and that was it... :( 

i had a toasted 6in with roast beef/ turkey/ cheddar... 
They didn't have very many veggies to choose from..... not even pickles... 

for some reason the sandwich was really small and was not filling at all... i was still hungry... 

It left me wishing i had chosen subway instead... 

and just for that dinky sub i spent $4.75... 

Not worth it in my book...</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I went last night with the wife. There were about 8 people inside when we got there. The menu is up on the wall above the register. It's about 25 pictures, each numbered and labeled. We each ordered a Schwarma, me lamb and her chicken. We both said our orders by name, then the man at the register insisted we order by number. He was kind enough about it, but it was just odd. There appeared to be no language barrier, so I don't know why this is an issue.

So, the system was about par with Culvers. You get your drink and they bring the food to you reasonably quick. While waiting there are some beautiful pictures up on the wall to admire. The dining area is a little wide open and doesn't have anything else in it.



Our plates came with a salad, rice, hummus, yogurt sauce, and pita bread. The yogurt sauce had a mint flavor to it. It was fine in quality, but not my favorite. The hummus was thinner then I'm used to, but good. It had some nice paprika and olive oil on it.  The salad was some lettuce, tomatoes, onion, and herbs. The rice was great. Extremely light and just great quality. The lamb was the best quality lamb I've had in Madison. It was tender with a light seasoning on it. 

While we were eating a group of three came in. They attempted to add chicken to a menu item that didn't have it and then ordered by name. Confusion ensued and I had some good entertainment with my meal.

Mediterranean Cafe is still the king of Mediterranean on State St. and Bunky's  keeps the best hummus title. This place is worth trying out and I'd likely head back.

As a note the credit card machine still prints out receipts with the name Tiger Lilly.  I believe the owner of Tiger Lilly opened this place. I'll be curious to see how it shows on my statement.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Ok, so great food without the typical steak house menu.

The pate was good, the hamachi was above average, the steak was good as well.

The popovers where the best part of the place, good try for a not so ordinary steak house.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Joey's was clean and the staff was friendly. I had the Italian beef sandwich with fries and a soda. The total was about $10 for my meal and the quality of the beef was good. I would definitely come back. Oh, got to have the cheese sauce with the fries though :)</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>FTR!? Yea of course I'm gonna try to get it. Will I fail or succeed? I'll find out soon. 

It seems like forever that I've waited for Chef Marc to open up one of his Novecento in the SW, been kind of stalking this location for awhile. Anyways Novecento is probably one of my favorite pizza spots of this style, the other is Settabello even though as a whole I think they're 2 different kind of businesses, similar but different. You come in select your size, your sauce, your toppings, and in 90 seconds or so you have your pizza hot and ready to eat.  They have a huge selection of toppings too many for me to name but there must have been about 20-40. Pepperoni, capers, smoked salmon, salami, spicy salami, sundried tomato, just to name a few. There was a lunch special for $8.99 which included a 7 inch one topping margherita pizza, a small salad, and a drink. I went with white sauce, pesto, and spicy salami on the pizza it was pretty good a little on the greasy side but good flavor. I went with the arugula salad which came with some balsamic vinegar, delicious, there was a mixture of 2 kinds of olives in it, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, and other things. Tossing some of the salad on the pizza made it so good that I wanted another. That's just one pizza, do whatever combination you want, one or more topping, top it with a salad or not. I've had their pizzas at their other location up north, they're delicious.

For you gelato fans there's gelato too. The guy told me half was from Art of Flavors so looks like I don't have to drive far for my AOF. AOF is a gelato shop in the center of town doing all kinds of unique flavors and I always see people checking in. I'll be checking in here more often what's the point of me going to the gym.

There's also Italian coffee, drink them as is or with some gelato. 

It's located right next to Kobe Sushi north of the 215 on S. Rainbow. Parking has already been limited with the number of businesses around the plaza so park in the back of the building if there's no parking. It seems a lot smaller when compared to the original location. I'd say there's enough seats but once people start finding out it's here forget about dining inside during lunch take it to go. I'll definitely be back before the end of the week or tomorrow.

Also pick up one of their loyalty cards. Buy 10 pizzas or salad and get a free 10" two topping pizza. Looks like the special counts for only 1 at least that how many stamps I got.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I love teriyaki and I know good teriyaki. This is the absolute best. If you want fresh food with huge portion sizes. This is the place to go, even if you're looking for a healthier option, they've got you covered. I eat here a couple times a week with the kids, they love it too and I've got some picky eaters. Check them out, you won't be sorry.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I gave this place three stars, but need to provide an explanation before reviewing:

In high school I participated in a foreign exchange program going to the small town of Nagold in southwest Germany. The town's fire department is by volunteer and my host family put in much time and dedication into the fire brigade. That being said, they had a lot of interest in the firefighting industry. Flash forward: a couple years ago they stopped by Phoenix while visiting the US and really wanted to go to the Hall of Flame. And thus, I had my first experience at this museum.

I must interject and say I'm not really interested in firefighting. Not at all. Needless to say, I found this museum pretty boring. However, I try to think of it objectively. I think they have a lot of interesting stuff if you're into firefighting or have little kids at home. I think it's presented well and theoretically could be entertaining if historical firefighting antiques/artifacts interest you, but on the personal level, I don't really care for it.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I never give 1 star before. But this time... We wait here for over 30 minutes to get our hot pot. When we finally got it so disappointing. The hot pot is really really has no flavor, it tastes like nothing even we order a spicy flavor! So does the BBQ. 

And it wait so long! We just decided move to another restaurant.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Great place. I got the pork sliders, and they were very good except for that the sauce was a bit too sugary. 
My grandparents got the fish tacos, and they were pretty good. 
I give 2 less points because of the horribly loud music. I couldn't even hold a conversation in this place. It's a whole lot of screaming and only hearing half of what the person is saying. 
The girls are almost too cheerful, but are very sweet. Their tops are too revealing, but clearly it's what the "boys" that come here want to see. It's sad....
There are also too many tv's. It's just about all a person can do in this place is watch it, because you won't hear anyone speaking at your table. 
I would come back here. The other food looks like it has potential. I wish I could give 3.5 stars :)</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!  I can't get over how delicious these waffels are. And the amount of fresh fruit is unbelievable! I got mine with strawberries, bananas, and whip cream. I'm guessing that it was topped with an entire banana and I can't even imagine how many sliced fresh strawberries. Seriously delicious. Does it take some time to make? Well yes since they are fresh and made to order and it's well worth it. Those who complain about the wait should stick to fast food restaurants.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Gentrification be damed, this place is still (barely) standing. 

First off let me warn you that the salsa that comes with the chips is HOT. Not just a little spicy - like 5 alarm rip your own tongue out hot.

That aside, the food here is really good. I usually order 3 rolled chicken tacos with gaucamole or the cheese enchiladas. They never get it wrong. Everything on the menu is cheap, fast and damn good. They are also speedy with the drink refills which always rocks.

Also, you can actually catch a bus to Jaurez from their parking lot as the local scary bus to Mexico departs from the depot next door. That is pretty hot too.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Not bad, but for basically the same price, you can do a lot better. 

One of Ruth's signatures is that their steaks come out on a plate of sizzling butter. If that sounds a little rich and decadent, it's not...it's VERY rich and decadent. That being said if you're going to eat at Ruth's Chris, you might as well go with it. It will make you feel like crap for days, but it tastes really good.

Again, for the same money you can dine at Morton's, Donnavon's or Mastro's, all of which I think are superior, but if those places are all booked, or for some reason you just want to visit the one that was here first, Ruth's Chris is still a pretty good steak.</review:review_text>

I tried this place for the first time a couple weeks ago when they just opened. Great friendly staff and great menu selections. I had the Local Pita - delish!

Very happy there is a quick healthy to go food place close to home!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Taking its name from the most famous of land marks whose shadow it sits in, Il Castello is a dissapointment from the moment you walk in.

Despite being recently redecorated, the outside still seems shabby, and already the place is starting to look as though it could do with a lick of paint on the inside. As we arrived we were greeted by a surly waiter who communicated soley in grunts, and then promptly forgot about us. It took almost 20 mins to get a seat in a deserted restaurant.

The menu is huge, so there is little chance of finding something you dislike - but the food itself was on the tasteless side despite being well priced.

Overall, Il Castello wont be somewhere I will be frequenting.</review:review_text>

The women tending the chocolate bar are like grandmotherly versions of Oopma-Loompas, bewitching your chocolate, pecan, nougat, peanut brittle, caramel, and fondant fantasies.  Oh, and they provide a free sample and a discount on purchases (a substantial percentage) if you are on their list of businesses that qualify.  I was stoked to find that my job was worth discounted chocolate.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>As good as it gets for a Taco Hell... The cashier, Lani, who served us even knew how to do basic math in her head!!!  

It's really sad when you are impressed that a cashier can do this at a fast food place, but good for Lani for not following the register and giving my friend $206,000 when the register created an error for itself. :)  She didn't even pull out a calculator. :)

But that would have been a great win on the way to Vegas.

Lani was friendly and took control of it all with a smile. :)  It was great... she said, "It's fast food, not rocket science". 

I had to die laughing when I heard that one. :)

Bathroom was clean and everything was well stocked.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Omg! This place is awesome. I wish it had opened a year ago since I live right next door. The fish tacos are amazing, but I've sampled all their meats and its all good! Great prices, amazing food, super authentic, and it's quick! The owners are really friendly and the place is clean! Definitely check it out. Seriously I want fish tacos right now.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>What struck me about this place is that is it HUGE. 30+ Lanes, and also an expansive bar (21+ to enter) area with two bars, tons of dart boards and at least 8 pool tables. 

It was bumping on a Saturday night. We got our name down for a lane, and waited in the bar, where they have at least 10 beers on tap, a couple of them local brews. The pitchers are cheap ($7-11). Regular drink specials are advertised. We were bowling within 20 minutes of arriving. 

It was a Saturday night, so shoe rental was $2.50 and games were $3.75 each. If you were to go in the middle of a weekday, you'll pay $1 for shoes and $2.50 for a game. I'll admit, my star rating is a little arbitrary in this case, as I am no bowling aficionado. The lanes seemed dandy to me. We had no problems, and the computer interface was easy to use.

We did not have anything to eat at Bowl-A-Vard. It looks like they offer more than the standard bowling alley pizza and fried food. Someone else will have to tell us how the snacks are.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I came here because I wanted to buy local gourmet popcorn to send to a friend as part of a care package.  I first tried to go to Yuri's, but it was closed down.  Second, I tried this place.  It is located inside a shopping center and a little hidden away if you aren't looking closely.

The inside is cute and quirky with lots of treats laid out everywhere.  I was really happy to see they had lots of bags of caramel popcorn prepared for sale.  I was a little concerned that the popcorn would not stay good if I had to send it via mail, but the bag indicates that it should stay good for 2 months!  The packaging of the bag was really cute too.

The price of the popcorn was on the high side - more than $8 per 8 oz. bag.  And the flavor of the popcorn was just regular.  I got the "junk food" variety which came with caramel popcorn and caramel covered potato chips and peanuts.  Nothing about it blew me away (I actually did not like the potato chip bits), so I can't say I'd make the trip to come here again for the popcorn - but I would be willing to try something else on their menu. **Updated to add that two weeks later the unfinished bag of popcorn is still sitting in my kitchen, so it was clearly underwhelming. I decided to just toss the rest.

Also take note that their summer hours mean they don't open until 11 a.m. and close at 6 p.m.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I usually try to visit this place on Tuesday's because their burgers are only $2.00 plus $.50 for cheese.  A basket of fries which is enough to feed 2 is only $3.00.  It can't be beat.  I usually go when I take my lunch break from work with a fellow co-worker and friend.  Another reason that I like this place is that they give you a carafe of soda so you don't run out.  They do have a decent Happy Hour which is mostly only discounts off beers.   But they are cool because they have Blue Moon on tap.  Their mixed drinks are more expense than most bars that I visit.

The regular patrons that I see in the place seem all to be retired because they are always talking about their golf game or when they are going to golf next.  When one enters the place one of the bartender's automatically know their drink and have it ready for them by the time they take a seat.  It is a pretty laid back environment 2 guys that seem to run the place are usually hanging out at the bar.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>My new favorite Madison restaurant. Best of the best. Elegant atmosphere, prompt service, an incredible progressive Chinese (not the usual nor traditional) and Sushi menu. The unagi maki was the best I've had, the beef soup indescribably good with chili oil and vinegar. The plain outside hides a beautiful interior-I kind of like that.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I went on a Sunday afternoon with two other people. I had looked at pictures online and expected to walk into a restaurant that looked like a club. However, I thought the ambience was great. They have some very original light fixtures, a sushi bar, a regular bar, and great details on the walls. The sushi bar is the focus and center of the restaurant. It's surrounded by one side with tables and booths, price rooms on another, the bar, and then some floor seating on the far wall, near the entrance.

They have 2 menus, Japanese and Chinese. Both were big and interesting, but we stuck with the Chinese for our first shot. The other two in my group ordered the hand pulled noodles, one beef and one vegetarian. The beef was plentiful but fatty. It was perfectly cooked and had great flavor though. The book choy, broccoli, and pea pods in the vegetarian were crisp and fit perfectly in the clear broth. We had decided to try the place for the noodles and they were worth it. They were tasty and fresh, much better then Hong Kong Station's street noodles.

I ordered the crispy duck. I've had horrible luck with duck in Madison. This changed that! It wason par with what I've had in Chicago and London's China Towns. The only complaint I have for the dish was that it came with a spice rub instead of a plum or other sauce. The rub was good, I think it was salt and Szechuan pepper, but I'd prefer a dark sweet sauce.

The main complaint I had was service. We were seated properly and staff was kind and reasonably attentive. The complaint was timing. Right as we ordered another group was getting their food. They sent back a thing of noodles that they said they didn't order. It was brought in back and about a minute later our first noodle order comes out, coincidence? Then we waited 5-8 minutes for the next noodle order to come out. My duck followed this about 5 minutes later. I watched other tables, and they didn't appear to have the same issue though.

Overall great experience. $38 for three large meals and two teas. I will be back soon. I want to say to try the Japanese, but the Chinese was so good who knows. 5 stars if it weren't for the service issue.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Canton Wong 3 has the best delivery Chinese food I have ever had.

I have had the family bean curd, ma po tofu, egg fried rice, veggie chow mein and the veggie egg rolls.

They have never messed up my order, normally take about 45 minutes, and the drivers are always nice.

They take CC over the phone and they ask for your ID when you get there to make sure its your card. Good fraud protection :)

They leave you with coupons, and the food is already reasonably priced.

Only complaint is they are closed Monday and I think they close at 9, so if I want late night eats I have to go somewhere else.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Grand Ave Pizza just opened. We are very excited about this. You can get a great pizza until 4am. This is good thin crust pizza. The place has inside dining and a patio but it is small (cozy?). No beer/wine yet but maybe in the future. I am going to recommend this place and I give the pizza 4-4 1/2 stars. However- 2 things: hours; they don't open til 8pm. Earlier opening time time- say- 5pm(?) Price; $12/12" and $18/18" pizza. A bit pricey. A single slice is $3-$4. It's good pizza but it should be 2-slices/$5 for cheese and 2-slices/$6 for single topping! I will mention this to the owner. If they knocked a couple bucks off the price I'd give them 4 1/2 stars easy peasy!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Having heard about the opening on Twitter, I nipped in on opening night to see what Clerk's Bar had to offer, and, like Alan S, was pleasantly surprised.

I'm not, generally speaking, a pubs person myself, least of all for pubs with sports on the screen, but Clerk's has a dash of difference. The two screens (one showing a Champions League footie match on STV, the other showing a different footie match on Sky Sports) were well-placed such that you could position yourself most places in the bar and still get a decent view, added to which the sound on the STV match was up loud enough that it was audible over the chatter (I find commentary one of the most interesting parts of watching sports on telly, so in bars it's normally pointless for me).

Already well-populated by those in the know and quick off the mark, the place was already thriving with a lovely warm atmosphere; I only just managed to get a stool at the bar. Big tick for the bar stools, by the way - sturdy, in heavy cast iron with good solid wooden seat-tops that spin around for adjustable height (and for ease of fun swivelling).

The decor is stylish, in a woodeny kind of way, with some seriously cool lightbulbs over the bar (zig-zaggy filament joy) and the staff at the bar were really friendly despite the fact that business was pretty steady and they weren't getting much chance to rest. The menu looks really great - lovely slow-cooked things, burritos, burgers, smoked yumness... I'd love to have tried something but I'd just eaten, will definitely head back to give it a go as it really seems my kind of place. If they're showing the snooker World Champs, I must just end up living there!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Pomeroy's and I have a really ass backwards relationship. 

Typically, the purpose a bar serves me is to quench a thirst brought on by numerous factors, the most typical one being the uncanny excitement I have for making poor (but fun) decisions. Because of this, the purpose I serve bars is not only the obviously fiscal nature of the relationship, but I often serve as the harbinger of good times.

So here's the problem with P-roy's.

I never want to come here. Ever. This is the place I END UP at and it's typically the result of somebody else's negative circumstance that I don't really want to deal with (friend meltdown, death, crashed vehicles), and I almost always have to leave a place I like to come here. I know, weird, right? But I've been here more times than I can shake a stick at, and while I am usually the omen of good times to come, I always know that if I am on my way to Pomeroy's, not only will I be saving copious amounts of cashola, I also always end up having a blast and not doing something stupid. 

So the role reversal always sends me for a loop, and the bathroom always smells like fresh poop, but I can't help kinda liking it.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Prec. They will customize almost any item for it to fit your lunch needs. Outside seating is available and with the fantabulous sunshine in Phoenix, this is quite a pleasure. I'm not sure how great it would be in the summer with 100+ degree temperatures..but hot damn, a great place in the springtime! Go for a leisurely lunch, it's got the relaxed atmosphere thing going on.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Great Dane has a good hot dog. nothing super fantastic but when your craving a hot dog and are in this neighborhood this is a good place to stop.

prices are a little meh, and the fries were so so.
i got the reuben hotdog and it was tasty...except for the cheeze wiz in it. i don't remember that being in a Reuben sandwich. otherwise it was a good dog.

yelp.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Okay, a Sonic is a Sonic, right?  Burgers, fries, shakes, etc. That's true here, but I'm sure you knew that going in. 

What I'm stumping for here is their new Premium Beef Hot Dogs. For fast food hot dogs, these dogs are pretty tasty noms. Seriously.

Let's discuss my favorite: The Chicago Dog.  Sure, they offer a New York Dog, a Baja Dog, and a couple others, but the Chicago Dog is totally the one to get.  It has the requisite mustard, relish, tomato, peppers, and pickle spear, but what really makes this thing worth buying is the amazing, soft, delectable poppy-seed bun.  Y. U. M.

Yes, I cannot say enough good things about this gluten-laden delight of a hot dog cradle, because it's so UNLIKE the normal fare you'd get at Sonic. Crushed, mushy buns are pretty much accepted across the lines of all burger joints, but when one of those joints gets a lowly hot dog bun nailed PERFECTLY, well, then that's something.  Add to that the decently delicious ingredients (beef dog, condiments), and it's a winner for me.

Yes, I know Ted's is kinda the hot dog king around here, but I gotta tell you, this Chicago dog is worth a try.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Since arriving to PHX I have been exploring my local barrios for a location to get some of my favorite Mexican treats.  As I was rolling on 16th, I saw the sign...now if you blink you miss it.   I usually look for the big purple Dulceria across the street first and slow down as I near.  It is located in a strip of buildings that have seen better days, pero yo no tengo miedo.  I have stopped in 3 times to date.  On my first visit I picked up un grande Agua de Pina (Pineapple "water") and a few Paletas, fresh fruit/fruit juice popsicles (coco, pina, sandia y limon).  While the selection and the quality is not as extensive as one of my favorite places in Albuquerque (on Central just south of Coors) .  I have to say it is close.  At least my Agua de Pina was fresh and not the hyper yellow processed stuff I get sometimes at Pro's Ranch Market.  On this visit there was also a lady inside selling fresh hot homemade tamales for $5 a half dozen.  *Score*!

On my second visit I went in for another batch of paletas, and this time I also left with 2 Aguas Medianas de Limon y otro de Pina.  MmMMM....I liked how the Limon was still quite tart and just sweet enough.  The Pina I put in the fridge for later.  I also decided to try a Raspado de Mango (Mango snow cone) to which I allowed the addition of a little Leche Condesada/Azucarada (Sweetened condensed milk).  Not as much mango flavor as I was expecting but refreshing and tasty with nice little pieces of fresh mango.  
I need to go back to try the nieves/helados (ice cream), and  Escamochas (mixed fruit served with coconut and drizzled with sweet condensed milk or sometimes honey and sprinkled with granola or pecans, usually fixed up to taste) or the Pico de Gallo (in this case it is a plate/cup with a combo of any of the following like cucumber , watermelon, canalope, honeydew, pineapple, coconut chunks, mango, jicama sprinked with red chile and served with lime wedges).  They also offer some baked items like bolillos, pan dulce, and other pastries.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Let me just start off by saying that as someone who is Mexican American, I rarely am impressed by Mexican food restaurants, however, Santos Lucha Libre Taco Shop has revealed itself to me in all it's glory. The food is authentic, perfectly spicy, fresh and reasonably priced! They have a selection of 8 different meats with different salsas ranging from classic carne asada, chicken, pastor, to home style Tinga (MY FAVORITE) and you can combine it with your choice of either a burrito, tacos, nachos and some other things I can't remember. I got the three taco combo with Tinga, adobada and cochinita! MIND AND TASTE BUDS BLOWN AWAY! I can't get over how excited I am this place opened. The place is Lucha themed with amazing colors, paintings, disco ball, huge wrestling pictures that is perfect for families, kids, parties, maybe even to go after church on a Sunday with everyone. The tortillas were so soft and cooked just right and to wash down that hint of spice the horchata was just amazing and so authentic tasting as if my grandma just made a fresh batch. Go to Santos, you will not regret it.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I have to start this by saying i love the Eastern locale. This is still a great place and i like the interior. I highly recommend this location for affordable neapolitan pizza with two caveats. The oven needs a bit of dialing in. One pizza was slightly under done for the amount of char, the other was great though. The other is the gelato, it is not Art of Flavors, the pistachio definitely has food coloring.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Behind that non-commital door, and up some stairs is a fab little pub, that you may just miss if you let it pass you by.

The Blind Poet is a great pub, it has the feeling of an old man pub, but is in fact a great music venue and being so close to the university, its main crowed is students. The bar itself serves a huge range of drinks and whiskeys - some of which I am told are rare - and is generally rather cheap.

There is a great squishy sofa seating area and warious other mismatched chairs and tables strewn about the place giving an oddly cosy and comfy feeling. 

The Blind Poet hosts a great live open mic evening, and attracts a huge number of above standard acts.

The Blind Poet overall is a great pub, and I really cant think of anything bad to say about it.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The official Grand Opening is this Friday, March 21st, but they did a Pre-Grand Opening today as a sneak peak! 

For future reference Sunday-Thursday they will be open until midnight, and Friday &amp; Saturday until 1am. WOOHOO! =D

I am absolutely excited about how we have a Sprinkles in our hometown now! Whenever I would go to CA to visit, I would bring a box of Sprinkle cupcakes back to Vegas, but now I won't need to. There will be a cupcake ATM that will be functioning in a couple weeks, we be prepared to ZOMBIE IT UP to Sprinkles at 3 in the morning to grab that cupcake out of the pink ATM. =)

At today's event, we got to taste a couple cupcakes, as well as a scoop of ice cream from their wonderful ice cream bar. 8)

I have always been a fan of their cupcakes, so I'm glad I got to satisfy that craving today, but I have never had their ice cream! Until today! I am not a crazy ice cream person, but I have to say that their ice cream is ON POINT! I got to try the red velvet ice cream, I know, I'm so original, and it was great! Not too sweet =). I did get to snag a spoonful of their Captain Crunch ice cream from my friend, and I'm glad I did! It tasted exactly like it should!

I was so bummed we couldn't physically buy the cupcakes today yet, but I'll definitely be back in no time. Who knows, maybe I'll see you guys on Friday's grand opening! =D

CUPCAKES, CUPCAKES EVERYWHERE!
NOW THERE'S COOKIES &amp; ICE CREAM TOO!
TRY CAPTAIN CRUNCH ICE CREAM &amp; A RED VELVET CUPCAKE, IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY.

SMILE.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This cutie pie cottage restaurant serves up high quality lunch fare at a reasonable price.  It's a great soup, salad, sandwich kind of place for ladies who lunch.... there's the rub.  The place is tiny and the wait is ridiculous, even if you try to beat the crowd by going early. And the veggie sandwich isn't very good.  But other things on the menu are.  If you do have 2 hours for lunch and come here, be sure to get a cookie.  The cookies alone are worth the wait.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Have to agree with Timmy... located just off the 51, it does have a Roadhouse feel to it...  Haven't been there for dinner, but the combination Texas/Arizona (hence the name) cuisine is pretty good fare...</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Grand opening was the 20th of May. Stepped in today thinking it was a Brodards but gave it a shot anyways.

The place is new so it was clean, nice artwork, and a lot of employees lol.

Our server was a friendly older gentlemen. He was pretty good! He have us some suggestions before our meal and even advice on some things we may come back for.

Had the pork patty spring rolls to start. With two to an order it was $5. This was good! I liked the dipping sauce as it wasn't overly strong. What's the point of having fresh ingredients in a spring roll when your sauce over powers it?


My friend had the beef pho. $7 The bowl was small, but there were a lot of noodles. My friend said it was a bit sweeter than normal pho. Also that's really well priced IMO.

I had the vermicelli noodle salad with grilled beef and egg roll. The ingredients were fresh.

I was pretty disappointed in mine though overall. The meat portion was a little skimpy as was the tiny cut up egg roll. After mixing it around it tasted good, but nothing special.

Overall I had a good visit. Didn't try more. It was pretty average but I gave them a four because there was nothing necessarily bad I experienced and for the server.

Just want to say I'm huge on service. We had our drinks refilled frequently and being friendly goes a long way. I refuse to frequent restaurants like pho Kim long who don't seem to value their diners. The friendliness went a long way.

Overall this was a solid Vietnamese restaurant that I enjoyed and will return to. Is it the best? No. Will I rush to come back? No. 

One complaint is that IT WAS SO COLD! It's May in Vegas so I appreciate the air conditioning but I really regretted not getting soup because of how cold they kept the place.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I have been ordering the #7 (chili dog) with fries and an ice tea for nearly 15 years from The Great Dane. 

I love this place! The owners are so great and friendly.

The food is simple, but I love it. 

This is a small establishment and at times can be kind of crowded and other times there isn't but one customer.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I had a bbq this past weekend and got some stuff from Los Compadres. You've gotta love winter weather in Vegas. 60 degrees in January  = perfect time for a bbq. My friend was actually the one who picked up the meat so I can't comment about the store, location, or service. But, since I cooked everything I can give my two cents about the food. We got some carne asada, pounded thin (less than a quarter inch thick) and already marinated. We also got some chicken (I have no idea what the chicken equivalent of carne asada is called), also tenderized so it was very thin and pre-marinated. This was the first time I bbq'd with anything pre-seasoned or pre-marinated and it saved me time. All I had to do was throw it on the grill for a few minutes per side and it was ready to be diced up. The quality of the meat and poultry looked pretty good and the flavor was amazing. Definitely some of the top carne asada I've had in a while and it was a hit with everyone else. We have a ton of leftovers also, so I've been eating tacos for every meal the past few days. The price of the beef was roughly $5 a pound and the chicken was about $3 a pound, I believe. So, the moral of the story? If you're having a bbq hit up Los Compadres for some amazing meat. They've got 3 or 4 locations around town.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Sam Villa's HairShow Blowout Bar is such a unique and beautiful venue! There are upside-down parasols hanging from the ceiling that add creativity to the stylish space. I got my first blowout last night before heading to a work event and was really happy with the turnout. There are several hairstyles you can choose from or you can bring in your own picture on how you'd like your hair to be done. I loved the big mirrors and comfortable chairs you get to sit in while being pampered. Plus there is a fun step-and-repeat wall that you can take pictures with your friends to make it look like your walking a red carpet!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>If you are looking for a great fishfry this is your place. My husband and I have been going to Toby's for 5 years. We have never had a bad meal. Everything is great. My husband loves the chicken and I haven't had better shrimp than the ones at Tobys and I grew up in Florida.
It's family owned and everyone in the family works there.
We are there at least twice a week.
There is quite a wait on Fridays but it is so worth it.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Had to write a quick review to this place. 
It kicks Denny's ASS. 
The food is always done well, eggs made to order, fries always hot and crispy. 
Sandwiches are full of good, fresh ingredients, breakfasts are all delish. Waitresses are a good sweet/salty combo.
My friend made a side comment the last time about wanting my pickle, because she had breakfast and I had a sammy. The waitress, without a word, came back to the table with a plate of the crisp briny spears. Nice xtra touch!

All in all a pleasant,cheap, laid back, 24/7 diner, which is damn hard to come by in this day and age.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Well, what can I say?? I was impressed when I went to visit these guys in Glasgow and I'm equally impressed with their Edinburgh outfit.

They have jazzed up the space that used to be Urban Angel and given it their own twist.

The burgers are run down your hands juicy and the wings tasty and succulent. The shakes could do with being a bit thicker but that's about my only quipe.

Service was casual and friendly.. We were seated as soon we arrived. All in all, it's a great addition to the Broughton St 'hood.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I've just discovered William Street, where this gorgeous pub is tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the West End. So tucked away, in fact, that despite having lived here for 4 years I didn't even know it existed until a friend took me here today.

Although there are a handful of pubs along this street, some of them looked a bit "old man-ish" whereas I could tell as soon as I walked into this one that it had a really nice atmosphere to it. The décor is a mix of old wooden flooring and beams running the length of the ceilings, with modern-looking brown leather sofas to relax on with your beer. Or whisky, if that's your tipple, as I counted 70 different ones on the blackboard.

And speaking of which, that's the best thing about this place. I'm not a huge beer guzzler, but I'll never say no to a bottle of Innis &amp; Gunn. So when I walked in and saw all 5 flavours sitting there ice-cold in the fridge I knew it was going to be a good pub. Although it wasn't particularly busy (apart from us there was only one other pair in there), it didn't have that awkward feel to it as if you're in a goldfish bowl. Instead, the barman was friendly and chatty.

I've never eaten in the restaurant downstairs, but I plan to do so very soon in the future as the menu looked really good.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Had a great time here! Had only two problems-1) No purse allowed? How am I supposed to dress sexy and have pockets at the same time? Taking away a femme's purse is a federal crime!-2) Really hard to find if you don't know it is in a SHOPPING CENTER! I had never seen a club before in like a supermarket shopping center....but the space is actually quite big!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>FINALLY, I sample the notorious Fatburger, which we don't have up in the Bay Area.  And my reaction was--OK.

Yes, the burger was Fat.  The fries were also Fat, but that's the way I picked them, and I did like them.  Simple, potatoey, and no weird coating on the outside like some competitors' fries.

I guess if you desperately need a fast food burger and you're in the gravitational pull of a Fatburger, you could do worse.  I prefer it to Fuddruckers and might even take it over In-n-Out, but Jeffrey's and Val's in the Bay Area are far better burgers to my taste.

This particular Fatburger seems to be brand new and part of a sprawling outdoor mall here on the edge of the desert north of Scottsdale.  It won't be the edge of the desert for long, of course, since Great Phoenix seems to grow like creepy fingers of killer space fungus in a Sci-Fi movie of some kind.  By this time next year it will be 20 miles in from the northern edge of Greater Phoenix, and the locals will see it as a quaint relic of bygone times in an aging layer of this megalopolis.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Celebrity brings some pretty diverse acts into Phoenix.  I often hear about acts only after I've missed them because these aren't folks who are being promoted to the gills by their record companies.  You might have a week filled with Lyle Lovett, a mariachi festival, Cyndi Lauper and D.L. Hugely.  Jazz, funk, Tejano, R&amp;B, Gospel, Punk, Classic Rock and comedy.  You name it - it plays it.  

This is one of those places where it's actually true that there isn't a bad seat in the house.  BUT - it's important to know that some shows will not play in the round, and some will actually use a backdrop.  I've even been to a show where they roped off part of the seating so we could only sit in one area.  I've only been to a few shows here that were open seating - most of them have been reserved.  Though a few of those were only assigned by price - inner level one price, outer level was another price.  

This is an older theater and seats are kinda tight - but it's not too bad.  Just plan to get cozy with your neighbor.  The other cool thing about the place is that there is a little bar/nightclub feeling in the area outside the lobby area.  Full bars, often some good music playing.  Folks often getting a bit more social.  

Final note - you  know how when you see a comedian you shouldn't sit in the front row?  Well, we Celebrity you shouldn't sit in the first 5 rows.  You are RIGHT THERE and they can see you far too clearly.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>i have never had a nicer, happier or  friendlier server in my life. the man was a pure delight. so its somewhat painful to do this, but dont come for the lunch buffet. bland crap bland.  

the highlight is the starter, which they serve you before allowing you to go to the buffet. we actually got up to hit the shit out of the buffet but were told that we had to wait til we were served the apps. all good.
 
on the buffet the best were the condiments. the worst would have to be the food. not good. there is a much better indian lunch buffet around the corner that i will suss out and up-star.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>lets see....

they must have a slimmed down menu at this location. 

i wanted popcorn chicken and it wasnt on the menu. i had to settle for 5 hot wings, potato wedges and a soda for 5.00. i maybe had 5 wedges total in the box. and the wings were overcooked and not very flavorful. 

i was disappointed and I feel ripped off. i should have went to mcdonalds next door</review:review_text>

They have a variety of stuff, but not a good selection of anything. Cider and wine selections are ridiculous and the staff doesnt know what they carry, so forget about the drive thru.

    <review:review_text>I am completely in love with this place! They not only make the best tacos and burritos but el chino beans are to die for! I now have a true food addiction to this place and go a few times a week. They also offer turkey and chicken options if you don't eat red meat, which is a plus!! You leave craving more and without the feeling your pores are oozing grease. This is quality food and cooked/seasoned to perfection. I look forward to each visit and their staff is always so welcoming and accommodating. This place is a MUST stop and so reasonably priced as well</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Hard Rock Cafe is a cool place to go if you're in the area and want to kill time before a concert or a game, but destination bar it's not. The food is average and the drinks aren't anything out of the ordinary. Infact, there's nothing really unique about the Hard Rock aside from the fact that they jacked up the prices because you're dining and/or drinking at the HARD ROCK CAFE. 

I'm disappointed that it doesn't compare to others around the world and seems out of place in Phoenix. A Hard Rock Scottsdale would be way cooler.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Five and D!!!!! What a great spot. It's always open. Always. And things there manage to be pretty consistent, which must be tough with a revolving staff both inside the kitchen and out.

As a late night scene, it is a fantastic place to pick up a milkshake and some cheese fries (If you're daring, go for the chili cheese fries). It always gets a crazy mix of people at those hours so even just observing is pretty hysterical. 

What many people don't know is that it's also a great breakfast spot. Omelettes, waffles, toast, and pancakes are all present and tasty.

And lastly, it is a pretty darn good lunch and dinner joint. I'm a big fan of the Surf City sandwich but the Teriyaki Pineapple Burger has lately become my numero uno.  

Phoenix would not be the same without Five and Diner.</review:review_text>

My boyfriend and I get off work really late and the last thing I wanted to do last night was drive back out to get something to eat- these guys were kind enough to deliver the pizza without sweatin' it and were here faster than any typical chain pizza place.

    <review:review_text>The whole chain of Barriques around the Madison area are wonderful.  This one boasts a fireplace that my friend and I spent hours in front of trying to stay warm last weekend.  The staff was friendly and the atmosphere is cozy.  The extensive wine and liquor collection made me almost salivate. 5 stars.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>LoLo's chicken and waffles were my first choice but the 45 minute wait at 10:30am wasn't good for me so went here.  Place is huge and the waitstaff friendly and quick.  Food is greasy diner fair, which I loved.  They had a great dessert display case.  Breakfast for two, under $20.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Had a great dinner with the family and family friend. Started with the calamari and marinara sauce and the portobello mushrooms with dill dipping sauce both were great. I had a Brooklyn lager to go with my dinner. The salad comes with the pizza and you can order the house salad or upgrade to the Caesar salad for a little extra. Both were great. They serve the pepperonis, olives, and Munster cheese on the side. The garlic bread comes with olive oil with a lot of herbs mixed in. The pizzas are large enough to serve 2-3 people, we tried the clams casino, saprano, and Roma pizza. I also ordered the clams and linguini, which came with what seemed to be half clams in the shell and half liguini which is a good thing. The bread is delicious to dip in the sauce. My son had the artichoke chicken that comes with angel hair pasta, which he liked. We were so stuffed but we managed to try the Nutella cake. We had boxed up the remaining pizza for leftovers. The staff is friendly and accommodating. My 4 year old spilled his milk under the table and they cleared it right up and replaced it. The staff were quick to clear plates as we moved through the appetizers and salads. A definite upgrade from the previous pizza place this used to be, and a definite great alternative and step up from macaroni grill and Olive Garden.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Whenever I need to get my car washed on the weekend I come to Wash Wizard, and I've always known of the attached coffee shop but decided to give it a try this weekend. It recently changed over from the previous company and the guy who helped me out at the window was super pumped about their product and was very friendly. I made my own smoothie (peach, mango, &amp; strawberry) and I opted to taste their homemade whipped cream before I got a bit on my smoothie. The smoothie was really good and he said that it was essentially just fruit (not a lot of additives which I appreciate). And I am not a whipped cream fanatic but there's was really good. Even though this place is so close to where I live I don't usually pass by, but I will definitely stop by if I'm in the mood for a smoothie or some coffee.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Its essentially a greasy spoon café, albeit with a foreign twist, so there's not really a huge amount to say about it. However, I'd still rather eat here than go next door to Biblos, even if Aroma doesn't have the plush décor or waitress service!

If you want junk fod, but want to kid yourself it's vaguely healthy, try thi place. If falafels come with hummus salad then it doesn't matter if they're deep fried, right?! It's british junk food meets mediterranean cuisine, so it makes a nice change from the usual pizza or chips that you'll find in any other café with wobbly stools and ketchup out of sachets.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Place was decorated nice and was we'll kept with staff cleaning up after every guest 

Hookahs were the new starbuzz stems 
Which was cool because I been waiting for a place to release them in a hookah lounge for trial 

Although the glam and relax atmosphere was very welcoming the hookahs weren't 

My hookah lasted 15 mins and started to burn outrageously.  They changed my coals numerous times and I was assured the coals were bad so they sad 

Don't get me wrong I'm not one to complain but when I spend 120$ I expect my stay to be pleasant for at least 30 mins 

No dispect to the staff , they were great I'm just used to sessions lasting me 1-1 1/2 hours no problem</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I love the Menudo here! I get random cravings for it on the weekends. The problem about this place is The menudo is the best thing here. The burritos and tacos are very average. Its good for late night hung over food but that's about it.  It also upsets me that there is a service charge for using a debit card, whats up with that?</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Once, when I was a kid, I was reading a book at recess because I was a big nerd and that's how I rolled.  

This kid in my school, his name was Weston, came up behind me and, without warning, kicked me in the crotch as hard as he could.  It was the kind of kick where I didn't see it coming.  His foot caught me right in the jewel-box and lifted me a good six inches off the ground.  I felt everything go weak in my body.  I crumpled to the ground clutching my boys and screaming.  I cried like a little baby.  You would have, too.  

Weston ran off--I didn't find out he was the one who did it until days later.  When the playground teacher walked over to find out what was wrong with me, I couldn't even talk to tell her what had happened.  I thew up from the pain.  

When I could finally function again, I discovered my book had scattered a few feet out in front of me and landed in a puddle.  It was ruined.  And I had brought that book from home.

For weeks, nay MONTHS, after that, the other boys in my class thought it was so funny that I got nut-rocked like I did, that they spent most of their free moments trying to find ways to replicate it.  When I walked through the halls, I had to constantly look over my shoulder, lest I find a foot planted in my nards.  When I was at recess, I had to stand with my back to the wall at all times, lest someone attempt to crotch-punt me across the playground again.  

It was miserable.  I had started out first grade loving school.  After that day, I never once liked school again.

Sarku Japan's chicken teriyaki is so good, that when I eat it, for a few blessed seconds, I forget the trauma of that event.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Another really good village butcher offering quality red meat, game, poultry and gourmet sausages.

Friendly staff on hand to suggest possible meals and ways of preparing and cooking their produce and pretty reasonable prices too given the far superior quality to that offered by the big supermarket chains. 

The only criticism I can suggest is that they do have a bit too much pre-packed vacuum sealed meat, rather than having it on display and able to be individually selected by the customer. A small point only and not drastic enough to detract from a great butchers.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Yay for the AWESOME artichoke pate from the deli! It's always sold out hours before close, so I admit I had my doubts about revealing its awesomeness to an even larger public... but altruism won out. Best paired with the Italian pane loaf from the adjacent bread aisle.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I'll give it to Taste of Chicago, it looks the part.  Chicago sports stuff- check!  And that's where the Chicago similarities end.

As I must do for any place that claims "Chicago", I tried the Italian beef.  Hmmmm.... notsomuch.  Pretty bland, overly chewy, too thickly sliced.  Wait.  Is this store bought?  You really shouldn't have to wonder that.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>LOVE me some SONIC! 

I was raised in New Mexico and Sonic is a staple there . Sonic is on the main street and EVERYONE goes to Sonic and hangs out. 

Here in Nevada ... well especially in Henderson you can usually see some classic car clubs that come and hang out.

Reminiscent of the 50's drive in that you see in movies . 

You sit at the order box - order - and a girl or guy on skates brings you your order. 

(is it wrong you look to see if they are gonna fall?)

Last night I was out late and didn't get to eat until late ... did I mention sonic stays open to midnite and later? 

I ordered  a Sonic Cheeseburger with mustard. A perfect tasty old fashioned hamburger -and a Dr. Pepper.  

Naughty confession :  If I am wanting a soda? I will drive out of my way for a soda at Sonic - the crushed ice makes it perfect everytime.  

They also have slushies - sundaes - salads- and many other appetizing foods. 

Just writing this I think I may have to go after work and hook me up with something Today!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is a review for their location inside the Four Queens.

It is in a small space on the second level, overlooking the casino. There are gaming machines at the bar and the bartender took good care of us while we were playing. My friend is a home brewer and he likes to try local micro brews when we travel. He likes the Triple 7 better, but I preferred Chicago Brew Co. Their All-Nighter was great and I ended up getting a growler of it to take back to my room.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The food was awesome,  the service was quick, and this place is a hidden gem.  I had the jalapeño chicken it is really spicy but it's a good spice.  I can't wait to get back and try something else.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Good juicy sandwiches, but the bread is a bit too soft (I like mine more dense). They have a good deli and beer selection, and a fairly good amount of junk food goodies as well. My best description of the place is that it's a slightly higher class 7-11, but without the slurpees and the hot dogs, which is pretty disappointing. The cashiers and deli people there are quite nice though.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Cute coffee shop! Come see this little gem, micro roasters and creative coffee assemblies. Pool table and bar top seating. Try the dirty chai! Highly recommend it! There are sweet and salty little toffee bits at the bottom! Yummy over ice! It would be a cool spot for local art or open mic's.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Lets start with the friendly staff. The woman who took my order was running the drive through along with the main register. She did quite well and was very friendly even when some drunks spilled their soda on the condiment bar. 

With exception of the customer created mess the restaurant was clean. The food was mad quick and was ok. Some of the Steak in my Steak Fries was cold and their steak is pre-cooked. The Bean an Cheese Burrito was ok. I was satisfied with the meal for the price. 

I gave it 3 stars, because the Fort Apache and Tropicana Roberto's makes is a a lot better with the quality of food.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Every time we are in Vegas, we eat here. It is one of the three or four restaurants that he HAVE to go to. I've taken several family members and they have all loved it. 

The meat lasagna is the best I have ever had! Lots of meat and stringy cheese and a wonderful meat sauce that covers it. The flavor is fantastic. Another great option is their Shrimp Joe. It's pasta with garlic oil, pepper flakes, shrimp and fresh mushrooms. It is strong on the garlic, so be warned that you will be tasting it for hours after you eat. They also have a great spaghetti and meatballs. I know! You can make spaghetti at home, so why order it at a restaurant?  It's the meatballs and sauce that makes it SOOO GOOD!

Most the meals come with a salad or soup.  The cream garlic salad dressing is fantastic.  The only down side is the salad itself - just basic iceberg lettuce mix.  I wish they would use a spring mix or romaine lettuce.  The bread is very good and fresh and the servers have been friendly.

The only problem I can think of about Chicago Joe's is the location.  It's in a somewhat rough part of town in between the Stratosphere and downtown Las Vegas.  You might not want to be here too late at night.  Otherwise, I highly recommend this place.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is definitely the best pizza place I have tried in town.  I've eaten pizza at just about everywhere there is in Madison, and this place is the best.  I ordered their deep dish pizza with three toppings and I chose chicken, spinach, and feta.  The crust is completely out of this world. It has a buttery, flaky texture and a cheesy flavor as well. not sure how they make it, but by far the best crust I've had in a pizza. DELICIOUS.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>OK. You know you should have eaten before shopping when you enter a dog bakery and it smells so good you want to graze on the biscuits. Seriously. And had they served milk I probably would have sneaked one of the oatmeal apple treats. This bakery also has couture for all types of our canine comrades. My fave would have to be the hyper pink number that says Daddy's Little Bitch. Arf. Arf. Arf. Arf...that's our Schnauzer Emilie piping in with her version of four stars!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>A lot of selection. There wasn't anybody else there when we stopped in so we didn't know if it was open or closed. Once we found it it was open, we helped ourselves to a delicious scoop. Nothing wrong the place, just in an off location.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Went here tonight, I know it's only been open 1 day but there are some serious flaws in the concept.  The food was ok, nothing very good.  It is crazy expensive.  I know it's the strip but you are paying $6 for 4 tiny shumai.  Or $9 for a bowl with 1 cup of rice, 1/4 cup of beef and 2 strips of pickled ginger.  I got the BBQ duck and pork plate, $16.  The duck was bad, there was no meat on any of the bones and it was super fatty.  They did not render the fat out.  The pork was pretty good.  The pork bao was not very good, the bao was the frozen variety.  After asking for a beer and getting a crazy look from a girl at their bar, I asked if they were still open.  She shrugged her shoulders and said she didn't know.  5 minutes later I saw another guy at the bar, I told him what happened.  He apologized and got me an Asahi draft for $9.19!

Ok despite the prices there are other issues.  The presentation is worse than Panda Express.  There is no thought put into how the food looks.  The whole set up is super confusing.  There are some signs and pricing but some booths have no signs or very minimal signs.  Plus you have to pay at every booth.  You want bao, wait in line and pay.  Ramen?  Wait in line and pay.  Beer.  Hope someone is there, wait and pay.  My friend ordered shumai and since it's so disorganized they gave it to someone else after her.  Very poor set up.  Ultimately for the price, you expect better food and service.

I know they opened yesterday and it's a beautiful space, but quite frankly this concept is not working in its current state.  I wish them the best but I won't be back.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The food here is fantastic. Great food great prices great tacos Mexican-style. Although the parking can be tricky, try to find a spot and make your way to this great Mexican restaurant. The quesadillas are bomb, the tacos are freaking awesome. And you can't beat 1 liter cokes sprite.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I was rolling over 3 stars but figured 2 would do it more justice. We spent 2 nights here and I tried to stay in the room as minimal as possible. 

Review is for room only... its very rundown looking. Those flowery cheap curtains that match the bed sheets. Restroom was very confined. My car trunk seemed bigger. Not that I have used it as a restroom or so. 

Aside from the room... everything else is just just average or below. Valet dude was polite. Insisted on tip even tho he never parked our car. Parking lot is pretty big, always found a good spot. Front desk guy was cool... however offered no help on whats going on ON the Strip as far as shows an attractions goes. FAIL! 

2/5 because I have had MUCH better. Esp in Vegas!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I've been enjoying Chick Fil A since I was a little kid. It is my go to restaurant when I choose to do fast food. I decided to stop by this new location for a breakfast burrito. Unlike all of my encounters at other Chick Fil A's, this time was different. I went in and ordered a breakfast burrito. Most of the time, I get my orders fairly quickly when I go to other locations, which is what is expected at a fast food restaurant. First, it took them 15 minutes to give me my burrito. When I received it, the inside contents were cold. So I asked if they could just heat it up, which would of been fine with me. The employee apologized and notified the kitchen staff. I overheard the kitchen staff questioning why it would be cold and how that was impossible. Nonetheless, they finally took it back. I waited an additional 15 minutes to get a new one. So at this point, I've been there for over 30 minutes just to get a breakfast burrito. After the 15 minutes went by I asked for my burrito. I was finally given a new one. This time, the chicken inside was cold, the cheese is not melted and there was NO EGG. I ordered a breakfast burrito and it had no egg?? I asked why and their answer was the kitchen has turned off the machine that makes the eggs since they are serving lunch now. You would think, it would be common sense that you tell the customer if you are out of something before you serve it to them. It's like when I order a burger and giving me a bun with tomatoes and lettuce only, then telling me they are out of meat. How is that even acceptable for a franchise that is known for their amazing customer service??? So finally an employee came over and apologized for their service. She continued to tell me that they are new and they are young kids, so they don't know what good customer service was. I also let her know that there is no reason for their service to be slow seeing that there are 6 employees working the front area and business was slow. She reported this back to an employee and they said out loud that they are short staffed and how they are unable to work efficiently when they don't have enough staff. If add anymore staff in that area, there would be no room to work efficiently. I looked in their lobby and there was one customer and some in line in the drive thru. Then another staff member came by to offer me another item since they don't have breakfast anymore. I ordered a sandwich this time. The person who came to ask me this forgot to put the order in, so that was an additional 10 minutes. At this point, I just wanted to see how bad my experience can get. I notified the manager and he offered me a free meal if I gave them another try at a different time. Least to say I will be taking advantage of this offer as I will not be returning to this location.I have 2 other locations close to me that I will give me the service that every paying customers deserves. I hope they can change their process there so they can be just like the other  Chick Fil A's that everyone loves.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I love Nargile. The staff there are wonderful and really make you feel welcome. It's a fairly small restaurant with an intimate atmosphere.


 The quality of the food is stunning, with a really good choice. You feel like you want to have everything, so it's quite difficult deciding! There is a good choice of Turkish wine available, too.


 The owner obviously takes great pride in making sure everything is just right, which it is. Highly recommended.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I've driven by here a few times, but this weekend decided to take the plunge.  I'm so glad I did.

Comedor Guadalajara's exterior is pretty unassuming.  Looks like a brownish/pinkish box.  Once you walk in, you can see that while they have some nice Mexican items, let's just say you won't be paying for the decor.  When I went by Sunday afternoon their after church crowd was huge.  I was just getting mine to go luckily.  I didn't hear anyone quoted more than a 10-15 min wait - and some of those were crowds of 8-10.  Walking through the restaurant - it's huge!  There is so much seating I can understand why it was the go to spot.  

Also, I loved the mix of folks.  There was this guy in a cowboy hat, plaid shirt w/ jeans tucked into his cowboy boots standing right next to a guy in a full suit w/ a snazzy tie and shiny shoes.  It was really a great snapshot of Downtown/Southern Phoenix.  So yea, there were like 2 white groups.  But the rest of this place was a somewhere in the brown scale.  Black, Hispanic and mixed folks all hanging out waiting for the food.  To me, this is a good sign.  

The Chicken Chimi was absolutely amazing.  Some of the most flavorful chicken pieces with lots of red &amp; green pepper and onions.  I also tried their Pechuga Asado which was really good.  3 lunch meals, plus a 60 cent "to go charge" (weird, huh?) came out to $35.19.  We will definitely be going back again next time to try all their amazing seafood platters.  While they looked outstanding, I didn't think they were quite "to go" kind of food.  Something to look forward to next time...</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Seriously, every fucking eatery in town now offers a garlic-y burger with some bleu cheese on it.  I think you can get a McGarlic at McDonald's now. 

Un-original menu offerings withstanding, Sunroom Cafe is a nice little place to grab a bite to eat on State St. if you're looking for something:

A.  not a chain
B. kinda granola</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Whoa hold the phone. I didn't know anything about this $1.25 Well Drink special on Thursdays so I will certainly have to revisit this spot. 

I have eaten here a few times, as a friend of mine is a big fan of this place, but I just couldn't see it. It felt like he was talking about a girl he thought was attractive and she gets built up and built up and when you finally meet her you have no idea what he was talking about. She isn't ugly, but you probably wouldn't have gone as far as to say she is all that great, either. 

Maybe I haven't ordered the right thing, so next time I head in I'll try something new alongside my dollar cocktail.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>There comes a time when all pubs start to look like each other, and for this reason the interior of the Antiquary doesn''t differ too much from the norm; it's dungeony, (but at least it's got the excuse of being in the basement floor!) is decked out in dark polished wood and has quite friendly staff. Take into account that the general Edinburgh pub standard is pretty high, and you've got a pretty good quality place.

Location wise, it's a little bit off the beaten track, particularly for tourists, as it's in Stockbridge, so I won't be making it back there anytime soon! However, they do some good food, particularly breakfast if you'd rather eat than drink, and have some open mic nights, with folk music being the general theme.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Paradise Nail Bar is brand new here.  It is in the location of the old Tanya's Nails.  The space has been totally remodeled and redecorated.  It has new owners and a mostly new staff.

The new Paradise Nail Bar is really going for the younger crowd it seems.  The place is decorated like a tiki bar with a lot of Hollywood movie posters all over.  They also always seem to have a recorded live concert playing on the tv of artists like Bruno Mars, Rihanna, and the likes.  I was talking to my nail tech who told me you can have karaoke mani/pedi parties if you want to there as well. Okayyyyy.

I do have to say the new management have really made this place look nice and seemed to have improved the staff as well.  My nail tech, Henry aka Grumpy Old Man, is the best nail tech there.  He was actually with the last company and made the move.  I have always really liked him as a person and his work is AWESOME.  As I am writing this, I still have my gel manicure on my fingers from 3 weeks ago and it still looks brand new.  Now that is simply cool.  The other people are hit or miss, so that is why they lose a star in my book.  

So there you have it!  Have fun getting your next mani or pedi!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Oh yes, dive bar delux.

Frankly, I would never have gone here unless it were for my friends Amy and Eric.  It's there go-to place, and I'm glad they brought me!

The shuffleboard is quite fun, the jukebox is pretty good, too.  Beware that Saturday night is karaoke night, which may have you leaving the place with your ears bleeding.  I can't tell you how many times I've sat there on a Saturday shaking my head in dismay at peoples attempts at singing.

So aside from the frigtening karaoke, their drinks are cheap, and if you get liquor, they are pretty damn generous with their pours, so be warned!

I haven't gotten food there, so I don't have any reports on that!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Walked into this plsce felt very cozy. The staff was very knowledgeable of products and what's good to eat. They offer a Cleanse where all u do is drink the six bottles throughout the day, and u don't eat. U can have raw almonds. The one thing I noticed about the ingredients was they are fresh fruits and veggies. (Kale, ginger, spinach, coconut) etc. ......  for the six bottles of the Cleanse it's 48 dollars.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>= = = = = =  TACOS ATOYAC LIVES AGAIN!!  = = = = = =

YAY!  The menu and prices remain the same as before and the only thing missing is Big Dan.  New management (Chef Pablo and his wife) have already gotten the heating and cooling of the place under control by adding a new mini-split heat pump so it won't be freezing inside in winter and roasting in summer!     :-))

Today I went with an Asada (Grilled Beef) Taco ($1.25), a Pescado (Fish) Taco ($2.00) and a Tamale de Rez (Beef) ($2.00). Sides of grilled onion, a grilled Jalapeño, half a Key Lime, plus cups of Salsa Verde and Guacamole Sauce were included, gratis...  just as before.

This was delicious and inexpensive meal, so long live Restaurant Atoyac Estilo Oaxaca!     :-))</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I am always iffy about chain locations.  Usually you can not mess up a Starbucks too much.  This location was missing something.  The staff was busy having conversations behind the counter so service was slow.  The customers were not being attended to.  

I had an event near this place so I went two mornings in a row.  Each morning something catastrophic occurred. Day one, while handing a venti coffee to a patron, the barrista was handing the coffee while securing the lid, which resulted in the coffee tipping over and hitting four people.  While cleaning up, I mentioned that coffee was still under the counter and you would have thought that I told the barrista he was completely inadequate.  I would just hate for someone to lean on the counter and get residual hanging coffee.  

Day two - They ran out of something.  Not sure what.  But something.  I know this because they were all milling around talking crap about someone who was not doing their job.  The funny part is that no one was attending to the people in front of the counter.  Just saying.  The caramel mocha was completely average.  Nothing special.  Definitely glad my event was over but I am sad to see no other competitors in the area but McDonald's.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I am amazed that there is not a single review for VIP for Free! Well, all I have to say is that you are definitely missing out! 
I am the type of girl who loves to do research before considering anything, so when I didn't find much info about VIP for Free, I was skeptical. However, I figured "what is there to lose?" so I signed up on their website.
On the day of arrival at Vegas, Danille contacts me and lets me know that a Free Limo will come by and pick my friends and I up to go to Light Nightclub! Of course I text her back with the hotel and time. Later that night, sure enough, a Limo picks my friends and I up at our hotel for FREE! We tipped the limo driver and was introduced to Nick who literally walks us STRAIGHT into the club! The line was out the door, but we definitely were VIPs for the night! 
The next night we were offered to go to Drai's or Surrender, but since Drai's just opened a month ago, we decided to check it out. Since our hotel was next door, we walked over and didn't use the Limo Service. Nick wasn't there to walk us in, but he literally called me and told me exactly what to do!!! We got into the club with no questions asked!! 
VIP For FREE is DEFINITELY legit and DEFINITELY FREE! I loved Light and Drai's!!! We all had so much fun and loved the service!! I appreciated the contacts from Danille, the limo driver, Colin, and NICK for doing all this for my friends and me!! They will definitely be my contacts whenever I am in VEGAS!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I've only been to this place twice. But both experiences were pretty cool. I had fun, we went on a sunday night because we had a couple of people who were 18 - 21 with us and on that night... 21 and over get in for FREE!! whoo - hoo!! and the youngsters get in for like 5 bucks or so... i really can't remember when. 

There's a 2 drink minimum i think but I didn't really drink anything. It was ackward dancing around their big ol' fence. It was like... keep the jail bait away!! ha ha ha!! but it was cool, I got to cross the dreaded fence and I even fell while doing so! I missed a step and face planted infront of a bunch of trannys. not cute.

It was alright though, it didn't have all the drama like straight clubs. I haven't been to another gay club, but I'd definatly go back. This time, I'll be sure to watch out for those steps!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The wings at this LW were fantastic.  Not battered, but deep friend how they should be.  They were crispy and well done with a sauce that tastes fantastic (I got the hot).  From a wings standpoint, it totally gets a 4.5.  

I tried the ribs and they were pretty bad.  Everything else looked good though.  

If you want hot wings, this is the place to go.  I only wish they had some sort of hot-teriyaki sauce.  Oh well, can't be perfect.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>When it's my turn to cook, I pick up the phone an order Fuzzy's. Thin crispy crust pizza sliced in easy to handle squares - just the way I like it. I have had the opportunity to enjoy Fuzzy's dine-in, pick-up and delivery numerous times over the years. The owners have changed a few times and it has always been consistent. 

Fuzzy's is as close to Chicago-style pizza you can get without a plane ride. Vienna dogs, Italian beef , wings and pan pizza options are available. Chicago sports memorabilia and bold colors mark the decor. 

Good prices fast delivery gets a hot pie to the door.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Among the cobblestones and stonework of Old Town Edinburgh, the Southern Cross Cafe offers a more modern interior, while still serving traditional classics. Make the hike up the narrow Fleshmarket Close to Cockburn Street from Market Street below, and sit down for your morning coffee. 

My friend and I were in for breakfast, and they have many well priced options. I was naturally drawn to the full Scottish breakfast, but then indulged in the Double Belter, which was the same thing, just more prodigious. Two eggs, sausage, bacon, potatoes, mushrooms, beans, tomato - the works. And with coffee, it only ran me about £9. My companion had a more modest egg sandwich, which looked delightful. The Southern Cross is highly recommended.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Great pizza. I've been there 3 times since we discovered it 10 days ago. 
The crust, the sauce and the toppings are all excellent and authentic.
I love how the outer crust is perfectly crispy yet soft in the middle, perfect to fold; as god intended pizza to be eaten.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Good amount of services. You can pay APS/SW Gas there. You can't cash checks, however. They have a water purifier machine outside, and Ice. They have a deli that cuts meat/cheese, and has pre-made burgers, sandwiches, and a tamale warmer. Decent grocery selection, albeit a tad expensive. The owners/workers are cool iraqi folks, but they hate mexicans, which pissed me off enough to think less of them. They say mexicans are all drug addicts. How racist. Other than that, they fit the good neighborhood convenience store bill pretty well.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Burger King definitely ranks as one of the better fast food chains in the USA these days. This is the closest location to my house, and needless to say, the one I frequent the most.

I have never had any real problems with this particular location. They are usually very prompt, and take your order correctly. I don't recall any occasion in recent memory on which this particular location has messed up my order. 

Burger King has a nice, diverse menu of items - chicken items, burgers (obviously), and even some other random, unexpected thing. This is one of the few fast food restaurants (if not the only one) that actually offers macaroni and cheese as a kids meal item! 

At Major/Boulder, this is a convenient location for anyone who lives in the "Old Henderson" area.

If you like Burger King, I don't have any substantial complaints with this particular restaurant. The staff do a good job, and I haven't ever had any big problems worth reporting.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I'd like to introduce you to a great new Fox Restaurant Concept, Flower Child. I attended the VIP soft opening on Friday, April 25th. Being extremely hungry my boyfriend and I ordered a LOT of food and enjoyed all of it. 

The avocado hummus was recommended to us and it was delicious. A combo of creamy guac and hummus with flax flat bread. For my meal I got a "power bowl" with grilled chicken. It is hard to impress me with chicken because SO many place do not add any flavor. This chicken had lots of herb-y flavor and was tender. My boyfriend ordered the avocado wrap and enjoyed it but wished he had gotten a power bowl. The reason the power bowl is amazing is because the vegetable sides are FANTASTIC. I got 3 with my bowl and my boyfriend ordered 2 sides. here's what we tried:

-Green Lentils, very tasty but nothing overly special
-Smashed Potatoes- AMAZING and perfect in every way
-Gluten Free Mac and Cheese- delicious and perfect because I am trying to remove gluten from my diet. The only complaint is that the spiral noodles were 1-2 minutes away from al dente meaning they were a bit crunchy. The sauce was delicious though.
-Chili Roasted Sweet Potatoes- Most flavorful thing on my plate and very unexpected. Sweet and spicy. Mmmm!
-Roasted Cauliflower with Curry spices- Also incredibly flavorful and perfectly cooked

We also tried the homemade lemonades (I sampled all 3) and the Kombucha. It was all delicious. My boyfriend loved the organic beer on tap and I cannot wait to try the wines! Finally, we tried the gluten free cookie and brownie. The cookie was delicious and moist. The brownie was too moist and rich and falls apart in your hands.

Overall, Flower Child gets 5 stars on food alone. The decor is nice although more garden themed and not as many flowers or hippie themed decorations as the name Flower Child might suggest. Actually, come to think of it, the name makes little to no sense... I should also mention that the portions are pretty small on the appetizer and power bowl. I foresee this being a problem for them given the pricing ($15 for a protein bowl and sides). I know some people will complain. I will DEFINITELY go back because of the flavorful, healthy options. I appreciate the gluten free, vegan, organic options immensely! There is a HUGE market for a fast casual concept like this in Phoenix. Hopefully they will consider opening a more central location in the near future!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Random lunch stop. Kind of a hidden place that does things sort of Chicago style. They have no deep dish pizza (coming soon) which makes me question the whole Chicago theme, but they do have Chicago thin crust which I was told is the preferred style for those from the Windy City? I had neither of those items as I went for the $6.95 calzone served with two free toppings and ricotta and mozzarella cheese. It was good, but the crust could have been firmer or crispier, but was also very filling and worth the price. This was a good calzone and was served with an excellent chunky marinara on the side and also a friendly young staff was on hand as well. Likely will try the deep dish when they finally start making the stuff soon. Only a few lunch specials though and that could be improved, but prices are reasonable enough anyway.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>They've served food at this location 2 days so far and I've been here 2 days now. Everything on the menu is great. 6 of us from the office went there today and picked up a little of each meat, a couple sides, and some drinks. The brisket is amazing and the best you will see in Arizona. Beef ribs were unreal. The pork ribs were perfectly cooked, well flavored, and very meaty. I wasn't going to try the turkey but after getting a small sample, we ordered a few slices. The sausage was probably the best smoked sausage I've had. The grits were good. They have bottled coke. Service is friendly. About as perfect of an opening I've seen for any restaurant. Of course, they've been practicing quite a bit at farmers markets and various other places where I've had their BBQ too. 

Great people, great place. Highly recommended.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>What am I doing in a chain restaurant? Drinking of course. A friend of mine recommended that we meet here to start our night off. I had no idea what to expect or what this place was. I walked in and bellied up to the bar and was pleasantly surprised at the selection of beer that was offered. They had micro brews as well as beers from around the globe. This is from a chain restaurant and not from a specialty bar. You might be wondering what about the food? Sorry the only food we had was the jalapeno firehouse wings or should I say drummettes. We asked for the wing portion and was told that was all they had. Oh well, they tasted good anyway and we ate three plates of them. I will try to go back to sample more of their food if I can get past the bar.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I went to this place with my wife for an afternoon snack. To summarize everything:

Location:
-The place was cold, tables crammed together.
-Not very appealing

Food:
-The pizzas choices are very limited and you hardly get any toppings
-Ordered Margareta pizza (with etra toppings that you have to pay extra for) and they forgot to put on the basil
-Pizza tasted very bland  without sufficiently being seasoned, overall, flavorless
-A can of pureed tomatoes on your pizza isn't called "sauce"

Price:
-Over-priced 

Do not recommend this place...</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>= = = = = =  WEEKDAY LUNCH BUFFET!  = = = = = =

Nandini here is the resurrected version of Royal Taj!  The same ownership remains, but a name change was necessary due to a liquor license issue.  I stopped in today to give the Lunch Buffet v.2 a try and here were some of the features:

*  Friendly host.

*  Lightly decorated but comfortable dining room.

*  Right-sized (for an Indian Buffet) selection of 22 items, counting salad items separately. but not counting sauces &amp; dressings.

*  Mango Lassi to drink, included!  YAY MANGO LASSI!     :-))

*  Pretty much "the usual" Indian Buffet fare, with everything ready to go at opening time, served up to temperature, tasting medium-spicy and DELICIOUS!

*  The Chicken Tikki Masala and Chicken Tandoori were both "especially" 5 Stars!

*  I'm not a big fan of goat meat, but it was pretty good.     :-)

*  Tasty hot Indian Tea also included.

*  LOW BUFFET PRICE (for an Indian Lunch Buffet) of $6.99!  (It was $9.99 as Royal Taj.)

It's 5 Stars now for this 10 years landmark Indian restaurant with a new name!     :-))</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Buying a new bike can be a big decision.  Buying a gimmicky electric bike could be a bad decision.  Buying electronics from a produce market could be questionable decision. And lastly buying anything over $500 from a place that is located south of downtown, cash only, and offers no warranties/returns... seems to put the nail in the coffin for logical decisions.  But some how myself and dozens of other logical people have had a excellent to OK experience when doing all of the above.

Phoenix Produce is selling Fujiton E-Bikes straight off the boat from China.  And we're not talking "Made in China" hidden in some innocuous spot; this is legitimately Chinese...from the oddly sized tires (which makes it a little difficult to find tubes for) to the Mandarin/Cantonese (not actually sure which) that fills the instrument panel and indicator lights.

Phoenix Produce carries two models 36v and 48v both have max speed of 20 MPH.  While they differ in range 22 miles and 30 miles, respectively, on a single charge.  The motor definitely has good torque for a little electric motor...I've heard the 48v is even better than my 36v.  Both plug directly into a 110V (normal) outlet.  The 36v costs a little more than 3 CENTS per charge. These are bikes, so you can ride them on sidewalks or other bike designated paths.  No license/registration/insurance/helmet required (legally per ARS 28-2516)...though the helmet is recommended.

As for the no warranties and returns part...I can only say what I've experienced.  Sam, the owner of Phoenix Produce, has been very good to me in all my dealings.  I had some initial problems with the battery and charger of the bike, making the first week of ownership less than stellar.  Fortunately, I talked to Sam about those issues and he corrected the problems no charge...sure seemed like a warranty; but Jenny, one of his employees, said "He is just really fair."  And I have to agree.  For the price you cannot beat them approximately $500 a little higher or lower depending on the model of your choice.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Well...this is definitely Jimmy Buffett in a nutshell.....over the top wacky and colorful...a real escape from reality.  The food was great....kind of a wait, but they were really busy.  Throughout the meal we were serenaded with Buffett favorites by a guy on guitar.  Worth eating there once, but a little too kitschy to appeal to me on a regular basis. 3 stars.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Was there last night for some after hockey refreshments.

Have been many times over the years as well pre/post rugby at Murrayfield  and itsa  solid option as far as bars in that part of the city go. Good pints, good service, good seats and good screens!

Cant fault it really for what it is other than the decor just feels a bit wrong!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place is great! A welcome addition to our Monona neighborhood.

I stopped in for lunch at about 12:45 on Friday. They have a small menu, but everything looks good and is priced extremely reasonably. There are three small tables that fit 4 chairs each, and several stools for counter seating. The restaurant is clean and the owner is extremely friendly and welcoming. I was greeted right when I entered, and within about a minute, he offered me a taste of the spanakopita.

I ended up ordering some spanakopita to go, as well as a Greek salad with Greek vinaigrette. My food was ready in about 3-4 minutes, and my total cost was $7.50. Great! The spanakopita was delicious; flaky pastry, good feta, and well-balanced ingredients overall. The salad was awesome and large; it contained lettuce, tomato, red onion, feta, and green olives. And there was no skimping on ingredients - plenty of everything. 

I will absolutely return to It's All Greek - looking forward to trying the gyros and baklava next time!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Stations (casino chain) replaced the Metro Pizza at Boulder Station with (what I believe to be) their own pizza chain called Slices. We avoided it for quite awhile; we finally gave it a try and wished we'd continued to avoid it. We ordered what I consider to be a 2-topping pizza consisting of mushrooms (all over), half pepperoni and half sausage. We were immediately informed that this is a 3-topping pizza and would be charged accordingly. I have never heard of this - is this the new norm? It's always been my experience that two "half" toppings count as one for pricing. 

How was the finished product? The crust is extremely thin, soggy and lacking flavor; I am usually one to eat the crust edges, but this was so bland, there was no point. The cheese is exceptionally greasy and it didn't go to the edge of the pie. The mushrooms were sparse and carelessly strewn about; however, there was a fair amount of both the pepperoni and sausage. And oregano? It was treated more like a topping than a spice! Why is it many pizza joints think that good pizza should consist of large amounts of oregano? Oregano should enhance the flavor, not BE the flavor! 

Now, I have a high tolerance for crappy pizza; this pizza was horrible, in my opinion, and being charged for 3 toppings really turned me off. What can I say that was good? The pizza wasn't outrageously priced (compared to other pizza places), it was ready fairly quickly, and they have good quality napkins.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Came to this spot looking for Canters Deli but this spot was there instead..... I asked about Canters and was told it was rebranded 3 weeks ago into a Chicago Style Hot Dog joint.

Being a fan of Chicago Style dogs I was intrigued...

I ordered a Chicago Style hot dog for myself and a Chili dog from my friend.

After about 8 minutes our food was ready

At first glance they looked good size but easily deceived by big box it came in 

Chili dog was umimpressive,bun was super soft and fell apart after one bite.

My Chicago Dog looked good and came with all the trimmings but then bun was super soft and dog had no flavor to the meat.  
Bright green relish was good and so was the pickle and the chili pepper. But other then that this place did not give Chicago dogs a good representation.

What saved this from being a one star were the fries, they abundant and very good. They had a good potato flavor to them and crisp but soft on the inside.

If I ever come back ill order a basket of fries but none of the hot dogs...</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I live in the area and have had my eye on this place, stopped by on my way out of town for lunch with my BF. Ordered the carne guisada plate and 2 pupusas (pork and shrimp). One other customer present when we ordered, waiting for takeout. Wait was a little long, all was made to order right behind the register at an exceptionally slow pace- 20 minutes for the two of us. I doubt their ability to handle more than a small family ordering at once.

Pupusas (which they're apparently known for) were bland and had little to no meat evidenced in the flavor or composition of the pupusas. Disappointed.

Carne guisada though, I haven't seen on a menu since I left Texas! Here it's made with stewed tomatoes, which is a little different than the gravy sauce I am more accustomed to but very tasty and seemed authentic. Rice was moist and flavorful, beans were downright velvety! Plate was served with additional plain pupusas instead of tortillas as menu stated, bf thought they were overly thick and tasteless.

Props for having one of my favorite dishes on the menu. Underwhelmed with service speed and lack of understanding the English language- cashier should be able to successfully greet patrons and take an order in language of this community not just  the one the food is from.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Had a great experience even though I read a couple of reviews I decided to try it out and make up my own mind. I got the beef tacos and a chips with dip; it was great I was a little taken back by the price but when I saw the portion it was well worth it. I would recommend to anyone on the strip looking to get there money's worth.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Decided to give this place a try after I found out they had Four Peaks Kiltlifters on draft. That's always a big positive to carry the local beers instead of the normal Bud Light, Coors, etc collections. When we walked in the door the band that was playing greeted us, which was cool. Almost no wait time to sit down very nice for a Friday night. We ordered the Buffalo Gold Fries and some wings(Buffalo Garlic Parmesan and Buffalo Gold). The fries were pretty amazing and very filling and the amount is quite generous. The wings were also very good i'm a big fan of the Buffalo Garlic Parmesan. It's a very interesting flavor and not something i've found around Phoenix. Our server was friendly and kept our drinks full which is all I can really ask for. The only constructive thing I might suggest is for them to check out the Soda machine, I think the mixture of syrup to carbonation is off. This isn't enough to scare me off as a customer and Ill be returning in the future as long as this place keeps everything up.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>A few friends &amp; I went on opening night. The staff was very friendly &amp; the service was great. Prices seemed very reasonable on both food &amp; drinks. We ate the buffet they had (fajitas were great!) but I am looking forward to returning to try several menu options. The patio was fabulous &amp; the updated decor inside was very inviting. I would love to make this my new brunch spot!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I've passed by this place, ignoring it on several occasions. It's awfully hard to see scrunched into the corner of the strip mall and it doesn't draw you in with it's signage. I've seen it's poorly designed website and it's lack of reviews by people. Most of the time when I've glanced over I haven't seen anyone eating there either, so I shrugged it off. What a loss to me!
It was a Friday night and I was craving lamb so I cajoled my partner to at least go look at the prices posted on the door. Walking over to it I was drawn to the outside babbling fountain and greenery, simple, calming. They nodded form the door that the prices were within tolerance and we could head in. The seating area was light and elegant, folded napkins, music playing soft ballads. The mirrored area seemed to make such a tiny place truly expand, but we were comfortable not squeezed in. The proprietor, Frank was smiling and came over immediately. A lovely welcome, a drop of menus, a discussion of drinks. He showed my daughter how to make a folding napkin shape and asked some personal questions, but he spoke to us individually, including my child.  He took stock of us and volunteered his insight outloud, that we seemed to be happy, good people. While it would have seemed strange and disconcerting in many venues for some reason it didn't feel intrusive here. It was ... pleasant.
We chose hot teas and enjoyed having a broader selection than in most places and he left the whole box right at the table in case we wanted others.  We selected the Greek Combo appetizer with spanikopita, dolmodes and pita with tzaziki. It was simple fare, but a good indicator of the pita quality we would see later ~ fresh, not greasy. The dolmades were wrapped tight and flavorful. The grape leaves were properly seasoned so they just melted in your mouth. They were the best dolmades I have ever had. It did what an appetizer should do though and we got excited for the next foods to come.

I knew immediately that I was going to order lamb, but I wasn't sure which way. I ended up selecting the shank because the restaurant said it was their specialty, my child ordered the Keftedes appetizer as her main meal, and my partner the gyro platter. When the meals came everything was plated nicely. The keftedes were resting beneath a beautiful bechamel sauce that wasn't skimped on at all surrounded by more pita triangles.  I had to steal one of her greek meatballs to cut in half and share with my partner. These were juicy and perfectly browned, no grease, no burned edges, no dryness. The texture was smooth and we were very impressed. But would the meatball connoisseur be happy? My talkative daughter didn't interrupt us so much as she was busy saying mmmm and yum and mmmm again. Smiling. Spooning some of the sauce onto the pitas when my daughter got full, was an added treat for the grown-ups.
My lamb shank was perfection, in seasoning, in cooking, even the bone marrow required sucking out. While the rice was nice and the kernals moist and fluffed, I didn't find any seasoning to it really. I'm not sure if that's traditional, but I liked it for it's simplicity against the lambs more savory parts. 
My partners Gyro platter, was as standard as could be, but the serving was large, the rice was the same as mine. For them the real standout was the Pita itself which was fresh, warmed and easily folded into a it's implied role. We'd been to so many places where the pita's were terrible that I think we were extra happy about this. Although I think they were wistfully wishing for keftedes of their own.
Dessert was definately an option when I saw the chocolate mousse cake. I've been hunting for a mousse cake done right for awhile now. So many times these mousses disappoint me. This one came chilled and smooth drizzled with chocolate sauce, but not buried in it.. It had a fine layer of mocha, which normally my daughter would balk at, but she couldn't get enough. I would be happy coming here for some coffee and mousse cake alone! I think I found a new source of joy.
Fortunately other patrons came in and we got to see presentations of the the saganaki appetizer, baked kasseri cheese flamed with brandy and the seafood entree's which I must return to try. I noticed that Frank was equally personable with them and when he left the room the lady gushed over their food and whispered across to me, "Why is this place so empty, it's fabulous!"  Why indeed? Give this place a shot if you're nearby.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I would say the Phoenix Hard Rock is pretty average as Hard Rock's go. We had a nice time and enjoyed a couple of their specialty drinks while we were there. 

If there is a sporting event downtown the Hard Rock is probably busier. However, most other times the downtown is a ghost town after 6. We had the place to ourself, but their wasn't much else to do in the area.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>As lovers of sketchy Jamaican and Caribbean restaurants, my boyfriend and I (newcomers to Madison) decided to try Jamerica for dinner. We had sampled their jerk chicken at Taste of Madison this summer but wanted to get the full experience, not to mention that I had a mad craving for some coconut rice and stewed cabbage. It was cold outside, so we decided to grab a case of Capital's Winter Skal and get our jerk chicken to go. Entrees on the dinner menu range from 11.50-15.50 each, which is pushing it for me, but they are cooked to order which is much appreciated. Jerk chicken will set you back 11.50, and if you want some delicious plantains they'll charge another $3. The chicken was dark meat, skin on, bone in and we got 4 thighs with our one meal. The jerk sauce was not very spicy or flavorful, and the chicken was quite greasy. The rest of the styrofoam takeout container was filled with a mixture of stewed cabbage, carrots, and broccoli on one side and rice and red beans on the other. Not much flavor there either :( In my opinion the best part were the plantains, but as I said earlier it was $3 for about 6 or 7 pieces. 
The inside is very inviting on a cold night and the decor is eclectic. Next time I'll go for lunch and stay a while. In the meantime, I'll try David's.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Food is just as great as the Rainbow location and of course it would be,  I see the same sushi chefs behind the bar at this location.  More spacious than the Rainbow location definitely more tables at this location for obvious reasons. Service and food quality is always superb and at its finest. Oh and they close at midnight.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place is idea for those brave who already have a few bullet wounds.   Maybe some hard core tats too! went here at 8 at night and was already shaking in my heels.  Ran straight to the bubbly, that was overpriced, and then to the register. I was greeted openly by a pitbull/bulldog mix.  He smiled at my tender meatiness as I bought the booze.  Left as quick as possible. If I have any advise for those who actually like the dark side streets of East Phoenix...take the drive through.  Even though I bashed them a bit...they did have like every alcoholic beverage under the moon.  2 stars for that!  Could I suggest a paid officer or...a chain for the dog.. :/</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Service here is surprisingly good. These guys make sure you get your food in a timely manner. One time they messed up my order. As soon as I pointed it out, they apologized and quickly fixed the problem. The only thing that kinda irks me is that just about every time I use their bathroom, it seems that they never have any paper towels to dry my hands. 

As for the food, if you didnt already know, 90 percent of their food is fried. Which means it tastes really good while at the same time its kinda actually bad for you. Oh well, you know what they say. All in moderation! They do have some grilled items available which is quite tasty. But come on, thats not what you really came here for, right?</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>A great place for a salad, an ice tea, and a 7 layer bar. Another AZ favorite for many years. Aside from the delightful food, the selection of pastries is great. I love sitting outside and enjoying the sun at one of the tables scattered throughout El Pedregal. It's so peaceful, you really can't beat it.

A definite lunch time stop of you are in the area.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Awesome spot next to the sports book in Red Rock Station. Even though I personally like to stick to the basics (mustard, onions and jalapeños) there are a lot of specialty combinations here that I will have to try. Now if you're a chicken finger fan you have to have them here. They use a fresh batter that produces a light flaky crust, delicious. In years past with no NBA or NFL bets to place I normally would not be in the sports book during the summer but this year they will be seeing a lot of me.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>My husband and I live downtown, and Sam's has become one of our favorite regular spots (bonus that the AMC theater is right there, too!). The chips are great- a variety of veggie, tortilla, and won-ton chips mixed in one basket. The tortilla soup, quesadillas, and especially the carnitas plate are all highly recommended. The Orange Beso margarita is so delicious and so big we always split one. The seafood pasta was acceptable, which is almost high praise in Phoenix where most of the seafood we've had is downright nasty. We've never had room for dessert, but the white chocolate/pecan corn husk is the perfect little bit of sweet at the end of the meal. Prices are fair and the outdoor seating is cool, but can be a little loud when they are crowded and the waterfalls are running in the courtyard. The service has always been good to excellent.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Enjoyed the OMG Burger.  Significant size, topped with bacon, aioli, house made pickles, cheese.  Served with what seemed like a boat load of steak fries.  Good burger. 

The outside area is nice, fun, vintage picnic classic in a way.  The temperature outside was warm.  It is outside, so be warned if it was noon and 115 outside.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I go here because its near home, and is very affordable, a round of drinks for my wife an I can be less than 5$ if we order a beer and a call drink which is crazy for madison.  Its very rarely busy so we never have to wait for service, but you do have to deal with some of the regular joes who think its hilarious to call women "sweet cheeks" and force shots of Cherry Doctor on people (10 years ago your manhood would be questioned if you ordered something like that, but now apparently its okay for even the most hardened construction can order it and no one blinks).  On the plus side you probably won't get stabbed here like some of the other bars in the neighborhood.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The cheese popcorn was maybe the best I've ever had. We picked it up from the farmer's market.  My husband then went to the store and bought a few different flavors.  I didn't care for the garlic parmesean. Normally I'm a big garlic fan - but maybe that's in hot dishes. Granted - this was eating it the day after it was purchased. Like anything, I'm sure it's better when it's fresher.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Biblos is a stylish, comfortable bar, with a great location. Its great for an afternoon catch up with friends where you can have a few nibbles and some drinks. 

It serves your typical pub food of Nachos, Caesar Salad, Burgers, Fish and Chips etc. I have a friend who insists on going to Biblos for the Nachos whenever she comes to Edinburgh. I'm not sure they are the best in Edinburgh, but they are pretty good. I usually go for a Caesar Salad, which is as good as a Caesar Salad should be. I have often admired companions burgers too. 

If your heading for a night in the Grassmarket or Cowgate, Biblos is an ideal starting point for something to line your stomach with and have a drink or two.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I have only been to 3 other Cajun restaurants. I had the Cajun Combo and loved it. The crawfish ettouffe was very good, as were the other dishes. The garlic bread that comes with it is the best. It is toasted just right and if you go with friends order a side. This food is hot and I left the place sweating. I look forward to coming back to try some other dishes.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>So we have been driving by this pizza joint that seems to be perpetually closed, yet it looks pretty interesting on the outside...especially on this particularly quiet stretch of Cave Creek Rd.  Turns out that Johnnie's is only open Thursday through Sunday.  Johnny himself mans the pizza counter, giving long hellos to everyone.  Apparently, he has been turning out pizza in this location since the 90s.  So it's a total neighbor joint with lots of kids and families dropping in.

I would recommend the deluxe on thin crust...you might be tempted to go for the Joanie (slightly thicker crust) or the medium crust...but don't give in to this impulse...the crust here is perfectly crisp and quite dense, so thin is more than sufficient to satisfy the hungry beast.  Johnnie's has fresh toppings and good sauce.  But they do take 20 minutes to make the pizza to order, so phoning in your order before hand is a good idea.

Oh yeah, and Johnny will let you customize your pizza anyway you want...down to quarters.

3 stars for the pizza plus extra star for super customization and Johnnie with his friendly greetings for all.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Absolutely awesome and historic venue. The acts that have come through this place in the last 20 years is absolutely astounding! I would kill to have been at this place in the early and mid-90s.
Anyway, the place has good acoustics and a nice setting for just about any kind of music or event you can imagine.  It is hard to believe that this place used to be a porn theater! Though I think that is part of the charm.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Sam's is located in a dilapidated strip mall on the NW corner of Union Hills and 43rd ave.  If you see the demolished gas station surrounded by a rental fence on the corner - then you're in the right place.

Hours are a bit frustrating for this place since they don't open until 3 or 4pm and close on both Mondays AND Tuesdays AND holidays.  Hope you're not hungry on a Saturday afternoon while watching the big game, or craving Chicago pizza on Memorial Day.   And you can't eat your food here since there's no place to eat.  Go home.

Crust is thin like many of the thin crust places in Chicago, but it's also quite dry and a bit too cracker-like.  They boast the cracker quality, and take it far with the use of that meat tenderizing device to put the perforations in the crust - just like a saltine cracker has.  I found no faults with the cheese and sauce, but perhaps I had lofty expectations given their advertising the use of daily made sauce and 100% Wisconsin cheese.  I'll give them another shot but may venture elsewhere when I get that thin crust craving.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Okay, for cafeteria food the Viad Cafeteria really isn't that bad. They've recently gone through a remodel of the space and changed the menu options. Its complete with appetizers, a sandwich station, a grill, a rotating "world" with a featured "ethnic" dish of the day, pizza station and salad bar. If you're looking for healthy options, the sandwich and salad stations are probably your best bet and the pricing isn't awful. You can get a large salad with pretty much anything you want, meats and a side roll for just about $5.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>$1.25 well drinks are the main draw for me on Thursdays at Armadillo Grill, a nice sports bar - but the well drink special is little known about so it doesn't attract as skeezy of a scene as one would think.   I've been here several times, and I'm told that the food is pretty decent too.  Some restaurant industry friends of mine frequent the place as they serve food until 1 AM.  The bartenders are friendly, the confines are very spacious and service is always decent.   Check it out.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Love the concept, love the space it's in, love Colin for his hospitality. I discovered Fuku through a friend when it was just a food truck! My go to choice on the menu is the "Buta Burger" - mmmmm! Randomly went walking through The Linq with a friend and saw Colin had put some roots down inside of F.A.M.E. - an Asian street market. Udon, ramen, Fuku, sake, Japanese beer + MUSIC &amp; ENTERTAINMENT? Don't threaten me with a good time.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>What happened to this place? A few years ago right after I turned 21 a few of my friends took me to this place, it was awesome, loads of people, good music and two for one drinks. I though it was the best place ever. I even went on a Thursday night and the place was packed. Now, it's like it died. I came back to AZ during Pride weekend and decided to hit up some clubs with a few friends. I had heard that the Biz had a name change and was not really what it used to be, but, we decided to go here on the Friday night before Pride thinking it would be full of people, wrong.  We got there around 11:30, saw the almost empty parking lot and decided to go to the E-Lounge instead, or not since it apparently has closed. So we headed back to Club Vibe as it's now called and by this time it was almost midnight. Once inside there was maybe 30 people in the place including the staff. The music was pretty good, the new dance floor was shiny and the drinks were ok, but they really pissed us off when they kept calling last call. So of course we were running to the bar to get a fresh drink then trying to go on the dance floor, being told we weren't allowed to bring drinks on the floor, chugging the drinks and then repeating for 45 minutes. It probably explain why there was like only 5 other people on the dance floor. Maybe it's the name change, maybe it's the scene, I'm not sure, but I really hope the next time I visit my hometown, this place will have fixed its problems and become an awesome place again.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>There's not many restaurants, at least in the U.K, that manage to absolutely boss the whole pizza making process.  Pizza Express can be proud to say it's one of these well established pizzerias.

Edinburgh hosts a heavy dose of Pizza Express restaurants and they all have the same clean, crisp and reliable qualities many diners have come to expect from Pizza Express.

This West End (of Princes St) branch, however, houses a pleasant outdoor (candlelit in the evening) seating area that helps define it from the rest. 

Sat outside on a summers evening, glass of wine and tasty Pizza at hand, this West End branch is a great shout after a 'hard' days shopping.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I am always on the look out for good Thai food, and this place just opened, so I gave it a try.  I was skeptical, due to it being so new, but it turned out to be amongst the areas best, most authentic Thai restaurants.

Just one word of caution - order "mild", because they don't hold back if you say spicy!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Best "personal" burrito in town!  I ALWAYS get the chicken burrito with medium salsa and cheese.  The great thing the burrito tastes the same today as it did the first time I went in over 6 years ago.  And...the same cool guy is making my burrito over all these years.  It is always so nice to go in and see his smile!

The meat is flavored and cooked well, the salsa incredibly fresh, and you can't beat the cheese.  This place tops any other "build-a-burrito" joint you have ever been to.

Tons of burrito choices (regular or whole wheat tortillas), tacos, quesadillas, taco salads or "burritos in the biff" which is a burrito but in a baked tortilla shell.

PS.  You can pick up a beer or margarita here too :)</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I have tried everything on the menu except the Chimmie Chicken. That is next. So far not a loser in the bunch. Homemade everything. The Bread is great and the sandwich is even better. Menu is small but I say do a few items really well rather then a bunch mediocre. This the do very well! The Provoleta cheese is awesome! An Empanada for $2.49 can't beat that anywhere. 

I will let you know once I have tried the Chimmie Chicken but until then go and try them you will not be disappointed.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Came here for lunch today, feasted like a beast, and I was pretty much rolled out... towards a few doors away for some gelato as dessert.  Don't judge me.

After escaping the near 100-degrees that makes up an Arizona April day, we were promptly sat down in an intimate booth.  The atmosphere was very simplistic and classy.  We were given a menu for Korean and a sushi list on the side.  After observing an impressive selection, we ordered tako su, soft shell crab, and two stone rice bowls [fresh water eel and caviar].  Had I known my lunch date wanted a stone bowl, I would've chosen something else so we can try more items.  Don't you hate it when that happens?

The tako su appetizer consisted of five piece of steamed octopus tentacles dressed in lots of Japanese vinegar.  It was a pretty toothsome little piece of octopus and wasn't anything spectacular. I don't really recommend it.

Soft shell crab appetizer was pretty standard.  It's not exactly San Francisco where they fry the whole blue crab with legs and all.  I'm sure the legs were used for spider rolls so you really just get the body of the crab.  Once again, nothing spectacular and wouldn't order it again.

The hot stone rice bowls though, that's love.  They actually serve it in the stone rice bowls!  A lot of places around the valley gets away with serving their rice bowls in metal bowls but this place has your rice, veggies, goodies, and egg on the stone bowl.  It was sizzling and crackling for a long while.  This thing is hot!  For $16, I would come back for the rice bowl alone.  Note:  the advertised caviar was really just smelt roe they use in sushi.  

Overall I had a great and filling lunch.  Service was fast and friendly, food was decent, and I will totally be back to try their actual lunches.  Our total bill was $52.  Not bad for two appetizers and two entrees!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>In the early days of our relationship, my boyfriend insisted on taking me here. The best burgers in Edinburgh he told me. Located in Stockbridge which convinced me even more that he was correct.

When we got there, I judged a book by a cover and thought- this place? Really? Boy I was wrong.

Bells Diner is so tiny you could miss it. There is only a few tables inside, and it reminded me of an old pub. I think it was the curtains that did it. Anyway, the specialty is the burger. There is a range of burgers to choose from, ranging from cheese to garlic. Being on a date, we both went for the garlic of course! And there is a choice of three sizes of burger. Now I am not much of a meat eater but the boyfriend convinced me to go for the medium size while he went for the large. 

Well the boyfriend was correct, these are the best burgers in Edinburgh! I challenge you to find a fresher, more satisfying burger in Edinburgh. I loved the tray of sauces that is put on your table, it was a nice quirk and a change from the normal tomato sauce. 

If you like burgers, make a trip to Bells Diner but make sure you book!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Why is it most Food City's seem to be hanging on by a thread? This location is certainly no exception. The employees definitely get an A for effort though. But overall this is just like any other Food City. The typical regular homeless boozer hanging around outside, begging for cash. And the typical dysfunctional low income family that blocks an entire aisle. And don't forget the fact that 2 out of three Pepsi vending machines are broken and vandalized.</review:review_text>

After my overall disappointing meal (had high hopes after reading rave reviews) at Tortas El Guero, I decided I'd check out the ice cream here- thanks to the recommendation of the TEG server.  Again, the Mexican rep behind the counter didn't speak English, so it took awhile to convey my wish to try a couple of flavors before settling on one (she kept asking if I wanted the flavor in a cup or a cone!).  I was at the point of giving up and just walking out when she finally figured my question out...

Both flavors were so good, I really had a tough time deciding!  Ah, but I do love coffee ice cream, so...  I still dream about the coffee here, so a return visit is in order very soon!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I love that they put a Jimmy John's at this corner. Finally can have my #12 Turkey Beach Club without driving 15 minutes. Not to mention we now have another delivery option besides pizza, yippee!!  These guys make sandwiches super fast and the ingredients are consistent and flavorful.  I'd never put cucumber on a sandwich but it comes on my Beach Club and I wouldn't eat it any other way. It's in a vacant NE corner but I'm sure it'll fill in now that there is a staple here. The place is brand new and only been open for 2 days but there is still 6 people in back kicking butt making wiches!  Love it</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is one of these rare finds, A traditional butcher selling excellent quality meat at a very reasonable price. Tasty chicken fillets (with no added water), lovely steak mince and pork loin. The Steak looked very appealing and well hung, will be trying this at the weekend. Word of warning they are Cash Only so make sure you take enough as you'll want to stock up!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is not gonna be a long review but, this Burger king on Boulder Hwy.  never has ice cream cones / shakes half of the  time.  The last couple of times I went through the drive-thru they always say: "our machine is down"  Yea, only when I come in right??  The last time I went they were running a special if you buy a certain burger combo you get a free ice cream cone. So, I asked them about that and they told me "yes you get a free cone"...Ok, I said "if your machine is down, do I get an IOU??" Then there was complete silence...Maybe they didn't know what IOU stands for.  Once again.....good ole  NON CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!!!   They never respond to complaints or emails.  Thanks for NOTHING Burger queen. ( Sure glad Wendy's is just right down the street!! )</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Best strip club in Phoenix... no contest. Went here tonight after writing strip club reviews all day which sparked a debate among my friends - we decided to check it out since none of us had been here before. And why the fuck haven't we?? 

I'm pretty picky and I'll just say that every girl in here is good looking and has a good body. Even the least attractive girl here would be the best looking girl in most other clubs in town. Many of them are downright beautiful.

Cover was 8 bucks, there wasn't a drink minimum (but drinks were as pricey as any other club) and dances were 10 bucks... VIP was 20 bucks and wasn't terribly private, but it was nice. My girlfriend got some good dances and we spent our 80 bucks so quick we had to make another run to the ATM before we had even been there an hour. 

The place has 3 stages and the girls have to rotate to all three which keeps them from being available for awhile and that's kind of a bummer. It's nice though because there's always something to look at. There are a LOT of girls here too, so you won't be sitting there forever waiting for someone to ask you if you want a dance. I was told that the management here was great too and most of the girls I talked to had worked at other clubs but found this one to be the best by far. 

This place is a little more laid back than other clubs... the girls don't go crazy with the pole dancing - guess when you're hot you don't have to. At first I thought they were just looking bored, but when they come around to chat they light up. This place is more about mingling than watching a show.

Bourbon Street blows the doors off pretty much every club in town and even ones in Vegas. If you have the urge for flesh or out of town guests and just want a mellow time with some beautiful girls putting boobs in your face, definitely go here.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I stopped in here to give it a try for lunch today, &amp; found it to be ok looking inside.  It's a little banged up, but a lot of decor makes it kind of comfortable &amp; homey, &amp; they have well placed booths for seating, as well as tables.  From there on, unfortunately, it was mostly downhill:

*  There were no paper towels in the bathroom.

*  My table was dirty, with lots of crumbs &amp; other food stuck to it from the previous diner.

*  It's too expensive for this kind of place!  A Combo with a Chile Relleno, Enchilada, &amp; a taco costs $10!

*  The service took FOREVER!!  ...over half an hour between the time I ordered &amp; when I received all of my food.  (The taco showed up ala carte at around the 25 minutes point.)

*  I had to chase down the waitress &amp; ASK to get any napkins &amp; silverware.  (This was way out past when the taco had arrived &amp; my hands were all greasy.)

*  There was not only a TV on, but there were rock oldies playing over the PA System, &amp; then pretty soon there was a jukebox blaring Mexican music out on top of everything else.  What a cacophony!  HEY!  PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO EAT IN HERE!

Yes, the food was pretty good, but that's the only thing saving this place from a 1 Star rating.  There were too may problems, &amp; I won't be returning.     :-(</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I drink here occasionally mainly due to convenience rather than anything else, as I live so close by.

Let me set the scene... at any given time of the day there are half a dozen or so old men resting their elbows on the bar with a half-drunk pint in their hand, the jukebox plays '60s and '70s music, and at least one of the regulars will have their dog sitting by their feet... but somehow it's really quite cool in it's own little way.

The first time my flatmate and I walked in, the whole place fell silent...  we were the only ones under 60 or female! It was quite disconcerting at first, but very quickly it became clear that the regulars and staff alike very extremely friendly and chatty, and now every game of pool is invariably followed by a doubles game with someone (The expressions on their faces when they see that you're capable of potting a ball was a classic!).

The pub quiz on thursdays is always a good laugh, just make sure you take your parents with you if you want to stand a chance during the music round.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Roscoe's will always occupy a special place in my heart.  It was the first gay bar I went to after arriving in Phoenix nearly eight years ago, and the de rigueur after-practice meeting place during my brief stint with the local gay rugby club.  Good beer, cheap-'n-greasy munchies, darts and pool, and great satellite sports viewing elevate this place to be a good neighborhood hangout, gay or otherwise. The fact that the gay boys ("str8 acting," "iso str8 acting," or "str8 acting-in-training") congregate there is just the icing on the cake.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We were fortunate enough to have lunch here today - on their soft opening day.

This is a rare opportunity in Vegas to enjoy plates prepared by a Michelin starred chef himself, not just by a name on its signage.

Eventually this place will be a kaiseki restaurant - a traditional multi-course Japanese dinner - of only 12 seats, but due to limitated availability of uncommon ingredients required for kaiseki, liquor license, etc. they will only offer Japanese comfort food lunch in the coming months.

It was a three-course lunch for $20:

- First course: Triple layered vegetable soup served chilled - Seven vegetables in the first layer, soy sauce based brown gelée in the second layer, avocado and egg white with Japanese sake in the third layer
- Second course: Petite Assorted Appetizer - Flavored edamame, marinated cucumber with sweetened miso, yuzu flavored shrimp, soy flavored Japanese taro potato, deep fried lotus roots
- Main course (choose one from three): a) Chicken Rice Omelette - egg omelette over white steamed rice sautéed with ketchup, onion, green peppers, chicken, bacon and mushroom. b) Tonkotsu Ramen Noodle Soup Wok Charred - pork based ramen. c) Black Curry over Steamed Rice - traditional Japanese style curry over white steamed rice.

The first cource - the three layered soup was amazing. Very complex tastes mingled on my tongue, the potato-ish veggie flavor on the top followed by the sweet gelée, deepened with the avocado. All completely grated, but I was still able to tell the texture, scoop and taste individually or all at once.

There came the second, more traditional kaiseki-like appetizer. This time, we could see the basic attributes of natural ingredients were preserved, yet amusing presentation of craftsmanship was well displayed. The finish of shrimp was like what we eat for Osechi that would bring back old timey memories. Satoimo (Japanese taro) came with tangy rock salt. Cucumber came hocho-crafted with mildly sweet moromi-miso. Deep fried lotus roots had perfect crunchiness that played nice in the mix. However, the edamame was lacking the finishing touch. Not only that the flavor was nothing special, it felt awkward to pull out beans from the pod by hand.

We chose Omurice (Rice Omelette) and Tonkotsu Ramen for the main.

As much as I would like to say the Omurice was perfect, it was also pretty basic to be honest. Considering that Omurice has been less accepted in the US market, I can understand that the straightforward path is a safe bet, but for matured taste buds like ours, some you-cannot-do-it-at-home factors seemed to be missing. My personal preference is rice less steamed and eggs more runny. Also I personally like demi-glace sauce better, or at least the ketchup could use some twist.

Now the best part- the tonkotsu ramen! I was blown away. I know it's like cheating to compare ramen elaborated by a kaiseki chef with shops serving bowls in every 60 seconds, it was the best ramen I've had in this competitive Las Vegas market. The broth had very intricate flavors, but was not too greasy or heavy. Quite contrary, the aftertaste was pleasantly light. Chashu was a little sweetened, which added a unique perspective. Typically noodles are straight and thin for tonkotsu, but wavy noodles used by Omae worked to fully enjoy this rich-yet-not-too-rich broth.

In the end, all those three (plus drink) for $20 was a well considered price point. It's on a high-end for lunch, particularly for local clientele, but is a steal for the quality of food and service.

Some obvious opening day flaws aside, this place is very promising. I spotted some misses in the food as described above, but I will hold off my full review until they start offering kaiseki, a big missing piece in the Las Vegas culinary scene.

4 stars + 1 for a forward looking factor.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I am so happy to see another coffee shop in downtown mesa! I popped inside for an Americano, and it was very good. Very smooth and not bitter. The 12oz had two shots of espresso and was around $2.45 including tax.  They had several baked items for sale too, which I was told were homemade.  I'll be back!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I've been to this Applebee's about five or six times over the last 3 years.

The menu is, of course, classic Applebee's, something for everyone.  But I found the service to be listless.  When I entered the restaurant the last time, the two hostesses were sitting down; they lifted their eyes to see me, and then reluctantly brought their bodies upright.  One of them greeted me without a smile, and slowly showed me to my seat.

The waiter who took my order only said about two words, and I was supposed to guess what my role was at that moment in the non-conversation.

Zombies have taken over this restaurant.  It's more "Shaun of the Dead" than "My Dinner with Andre."</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>My coworker told me about this new liquor store right around the corner from my house. I wasted no time in checking it out.

They have a decent craft beer selection. Actually, it's quite good. I was just hoping for more. In the corner of their fridge setup, there is this "beer cave" entrance. I got excited, thinking they had a treasure trove of hard-to-find brews inside. I was disappointed to find out it was just cases of the macro stuff.

On the bright side, I picked up a bottle of the latest Game of Thrones beer. I didn't even realize they made a new one. Another bottle for my collection!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Like it a lot!

Probably quite a grown up bar. We headed here later on - closer to 11ish on a Friday night (V-night) and it was pretty quiet. It used to be the old Standard Bar - black frontage and from the outside appeared small but the bar is actually quite tardis like inside. Mix of chairs and tables, high stools and some booth areas which I'm sure would appeal to groups or those on date night alike. 

The gin is the main draw here. They have a list of the common gins they do on a blackboard and with which mixer they should be served - Fentimans or Fever Tree. I had a Caorunn and a Botanist, both of which were very easy to drink. It won't be the cheapest round of drinks - two G&amp;T's were about £10 but very enjoyable. Other gins can be seen on the shelves - Caz opted for a Boodles and they also do Blackwoods gin too which is lovely. We missed on on trying the saffron gin as it had been their launch night the previous night and they were out of that.

Nice surroundings - wooden floors, tables and chairs with blue/grey walls. Not overly bright inside but good enough for a late night supping gin. They also do food - didn't see any menus as they'd probably been moved from the tables. There was a bit of an older crowd in last night when we were in which was good to avoid it being too 'hipsterish' and the 80's soundtrack was fab. I'll return to further explore the gin menu and try the food!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I am thrilled to have Hy-Vee in Fitchburg!  Before Hy-Vee, I would have to go to several different grocery or specialty stores to get all the items I needed.  Now, I only need to go one place.  Hy-Vee has everything, including specialty items that other stores generally lack. In addition to carrying specialty items, they have an impressive variety.  For example, at other grocery stores in Fitchburg, I have struggled to find coconut milk, and the stores that carry it have a limited selection and supply.  In contrast, Hy-Vee had a wide variety of brands and flavors of coconut milk to choose from! 

Another pleasant surprise was how quickly I was served.  At 5:30pm on a week night, I did not have to wait in line to get deli meat or to get fresh bread sliced at the bakery.  At other grocery stores, I typically wait at least 5 minutes to be served. When I was ready to check out my groceries, I did not have to wait in line at all!  

The staff was very helpful and friendly.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Oh Goodness Me!  The gyro/s was amazing, fresh and tasty tomato and the sauce...the sauce.  The sauce has to be homemade, because the tangy twist it has just screams homemade.  Friendly owner, family-learned cook and knows what he is doing.  I'm scared to open the pastitios (sp),  because the speed at which I ate my gyros was like a food blackout.  It was a tasty blur from start to finish.  Don't let the ambiance turn you away, not everyone gets investors and can pour tons of money into the furniture.  I would rather have the focus be on the food, the money will come.  My parting words as I took my food home with me were, "I'm sure I'll be back, this smells amazing"  My final verdict is that, I most certainly will be back.  Thank you and Welcome to Monona.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Probably THE best place to get cigars in the area. I've only been here twice, but I will definitely be going here again soon. They know their stuff and are very helpful. After a short chat about what types of cigars I've had the recommendations came flowing. There's a huge selection, so if you do know what you're looking for they will probably have it.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The new Grassroots at 20th St &amp; Camelback Rd is fantastic.  I give it my highest recommendation.  The food, service and atmosphere should be experienced by all.  When you do check it out I suggest ordering the brisket...not to mention the grits that come along with it...you're welcome!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I wouldn't quite call my 2 experiences at Tempting Tattie a case of hit and miss, but after my frankly tremendous first baked potato, I was a bit miffed that the second wasn't so much tempting as vomit-inducing.

I'll start with the good one. Unbelievably fluffy inside, cooked to perfection with crispy skin, and with a generous helping of (admittedly a bit rubbery) cheddar on the inside. Five stars all the way.

On visit number two, I opted to be a bit aventurous and put a bit of haggis into the mix. Now haggis doesn't look the most attractive at the best of times, but this tattie quite literally looked liked a dog had been sick on it. It didn't taste too horrific, but it's perhaps telling that since this menu mis-step I've never felt tempted to return.

that's what you get for mixing haggis and cheddar cheese. Once the memory of that schoolboy error fades, I'll gladly give Tempting Tattie another go.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is a GREAT hidden gem! - And proof that healthy, clean food doesn't have to taste boring. A group of us popped in this morning to grab a late breakfast, all trying different combo's, and everything was to die for. The owner walked us through all the different ways to try the variety of oatmeal and pancakes offered.

The prices are definitely on point, they don't over-charge for anything on their menu. We all will be back!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I'm still not sure which way to pronounce it, but if you want to meet some real-life northsiders- this is a good stop. And it's not too far away from downtown. Some people say their bloodies are unstoppable, but I didn't love it.

The decor is definitely influenced by NASCAR and NFL, and they also have a pool table and dart board - with a fireplace. Probably a great place in the winter</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I went there with couple of friends for lunch. The atmosphere was classic yet casual, and the server was attentive to our need of quarters for parking and tea refills. =P 

The flavor of the sandwich is well balanced--you can taste the individual ingredients and their quality. The fries fill you up if you're still hungry after the small sandwich. 

It's a good place to have a chatty lunch.</review:review_text>

Review:
As a fan of The Deli, I was excited to try this place and it did not disappoint.  The Bistro, although currently a little difficult to find due to lack of real signage, is a cute and trendy little bistro with a great selection of drinks and good options for breakfast and lunch.  If you're familiar with the Deli's signature carrot cake, good news, they offer it here too!  The cashier caught me drooling and immediately knew why, so obviously I'm not the only fan.

My hubby ordered the special of the day which was frozen berry iced tea and a loaded bagel breakfast sandwich with turkey,egg, cheese, and pesto...both were tasty!  I got the chai latte with vanilla, and though my latte was a little sweet for my taste, they were happy to adjust it to my liking (I tend to like less sugar, no fault of the drink).  I also got the quiche which came with a salad for $5, great deal!

I give this place a 5 because for the location, locally produced food/teas, drink selection, ambiance, and friendly staff, it is a place I will definitely come back to.  They also have free wi-fi, maybe my next Yelp review will be written there over another one of their delicious drinks!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>As the first Yelper stated great steakhouse!

 Cozy, dim lighted atmo. 
 The variety of fresh baked bread includes a rosemary sourdough, raisin bread (not my fav.) and a Deelish soft fresh fat warm yummy pretzel (accompanied with unsalted butter).  

Wine menu is offered ( and passed up).
Dinner menu has about a dozen entrees, the entree includes on side and the buffet soup &amp; salad bar.

I decided on the Porter house Pork Chop ($25) with Mashed potato as my side and my hubby picked the Seafood combo platter($28) and side of French fries. each additional side if $5. But it's really not nessasary.

after our friendly server took our order I went to check out the salad bar.  WOW, was I impressed! started off with the regular Iceberg, then a Garden Mix, followed by a Creamy Dill Shrimp salad, Deelish and colorful Crab Salad, Also Plain but tasty Tuna Salad. Just as you pass down a ways, the nicely diced and pretty shredded veggies that make your build-it-yourself salad look oh so gourmet.  Salad Buffet concluded with a Minestrone soup and my FAVORITE Creamy Asparagus and Crab soup. SOOO GOOOD (chunks of realllly yummy crab mmmm)

Ok, so our Pork shop was HUGE, smashed potato's were real and yummy....
My husbands seafood platter was disappointingly all fried but he did chose to substitute the oysters and scallops for more Orange Roughy and HUGE shrimp. 

"First time I've ever been full off shrimp" is what my meat and potato man said to me. 

I'm sure we will be back, although this kind of restaurant is a treat for us Parents on a budget. (we were on a date night just FYI)

Our dinner was about $62.00 including tip but we did not splurge. The Surf &amp; Turf was a bit steep at $63. and Lobster tail about $48.  But I bet it's awesome.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place has great food (including fresh oysters), an open and relaxing atmosphere and friendly staff. The steamed seafood bowls are prepared at the front bar using amazingly fresh seafood. They even have several craft beers on tap. Did I mention they have a great selection of fresh oysters? They're also open for lunch. 

Finally, great seafood in the East Valley!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Yum yum yum! Of course L&amp;L opens up right by my apartment now that I am planning to move soon. Stopped in today as it's been a while and this is a brand spanking new location. Staff was very friendly and the food is delicious.

Seafood Mix - fried shrimp, mahi mahi and chicken katsu with double rice instead of macaroni salad. Shrimp and katsu were delicous... haven't made it to mahi mahi yet as the freaking plate was enough to feed 3 people.

Cream cheese wraps - otherwise known as crab rangoon --- this location was giving out free ones for their soft opening and they were amazing... I could eat 6 or 12 of these :)

On my way home from work so this may be a regular stop... if you are not a big eater you could easily make 2-3 meals out of the combination plates. We plan to split one from now on. This location is so new it's not even on their website yet.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Tried this place for the first time. I got the beef kabob with brown rice and naan and my boyfriend got the lamb with spinach rice and the salad bar. Both dishes were delicious! The beef kabob was tender and juicy with a full flavor. Loved the green sauce that came with it. It was spicy but fresh. The lamb definitely tasted like lamb unlike some other places that over season the meat and mask its original flavor. The salad bar had many different toppings with even pickled vegetables like brusslesprouts, garlic and carrots.

I didn't see the $20 for $25 deal until after we already paid but the owner was so awesome he gave us a large slice of baklava  on the house. The baklava tasted homemade and fresh. Just the perfect sweetness to hit the spot. The owner also brought out a savory dumpling dish for us to try which was like ravioli. Such a great guy!

I wish this place well. They are off to a great start!


Had to update my review. I called in a order for pick up and this girl on the phone was so rude and dumb. I met her in person and she was even worse! She has to go!!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I came to Mesa from Los Angeles to work the Spark Music and Arts Festival. Admittedly so, I am a bit of a coffee snob, as I was a barista for 2 years. The Lost Dutchman was right across the street from the Mesa Art Center so I figured "might as well, anything is better than starbucks." This place thoroughly impressed me. From the Esspresso machine and the time they put into making a proper drink i could tell they cared about providing a quality Product, and at a reasonable price. Definitely try the tomato bacon spinach panini. Iced americano was delicious as well. Overall great place!

The fact they do not use soy products is great, I would like to see them try to use more organic, less Artificially sweet  flavoring to add to the flavor of their coffee versus taking away from the rich tones of a good bean and brew. Less is more!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I really enjoyed my first experience at Cafe Zupas! The food was fresh and offered a lot of healthy options. They also have a wifi hotspot inside and a recharge station where you can sit, eat lunch and charge ur laptop/devices. Also, I liked the syrups they offer next to the soda machine so u can flavor ur drinks. They give chocolate covered strawberries with every order! Overall, I'm happy with this place and it is ABOUT TIME that we started getting better (by better i mean healthier) food options on this side of Henderson! Nothing but pizzerias and tons of fast food!! This place will do well especially in the hot summer months when a HOT meal just doesn't seem so appetizing! I got the turkey cranberry sandwich. I will be posting pictures of my order along with my fiancé's. I really like the turkey cranberry sandwich the honey mustard on the bottom was sweet and not to mustard-y Like some honey mustard's tend to be &amp; I really liked the cranberry sauce on top with the sprouts. Also, I got the chicken chopped salad with blue cheese dressing. My only complaint was that I wish I had gotten the same type of lettuce that my fiancé got on his salad instead of the iceberg lettuce they put with mine. There isn't much nutritional value in iceberg lettuce were as he got the deep romaine greens that I would've wanted. Although, I'm sure that if I had known that it came with that type of lettuce I could've asked for the kind that he got. I will make sure to do that next time. All in all this was a great experience and I highly recommend this place if you're looking for something that is not deep-fried or saturated in fat. Also, great tasting fresh ingredients!! The ambience of the place wasn't bad either!!! I asked, and they do do call in orders where you can come pick up your food if you like. Good to know. Come check this place out!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is a local bar and not a fine dining restaurant, but they have a very friendly staff and serve a great Friday night all you can eat fish fry.

    <review:review_text>Seriously swank, seriously posh and seriously amazing. After coming off of 18 hours of air travel and a stressful car ride (this is the land of left-hand side driving, crazy things called round-abouts, and where street signs are on buildings not on separate posts), its was treat to arrive at such a nice hotel.

My car door was opened and I was greeted with a smile by a pleasant and friendly doorman. That sort of set the tone for the rest of my stay here.

Though the hotel was undergoing renovations, there wasn't really any time where I felt inconvenienced. Maybe because I was out sight-seeing during the days, and so dead tired that even if there was construction happening at night, I wouldn't have noticed because I was so dead tired from the day's activities. 

My room was stylin'. My favorite part would have to be the bathroom. Sleek design, very modern. The coolest features was that you could change the color of the lighting. So if you needed to chill, you could choose a blue or green, but if you wanted to rev your appetite up before dinner, you could change it to red or orange. 

The hotel was across the street from a domed opera house and within walking distance to the hub of the downtown area.

I definitely plan to visit Scotland again. When I do. I know my trip will include lodgings at this establishment. Hands down my favorite hotel in the UK.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Beets has all the trimmings of the new wave of up market delicatessens: you'll find organic fruit and veg, preserves and the rest.

Where it gets interesting is Beets' selection of beers. They sell plenty of unique brands, but the eye opener is Brewdog's own Tactical Nuclear Penguin. Good lord this stuff is powerful!

No wonder it's associated with a weapon of mass destruction, because this will be the only eventual outcome after even a sip of its 32% content.  It's expensive and should only be drank in strict moderation, but having tried some myself I found it to be like a really strong tasting stout with after affects akin to a mule kick in the face...

Still, good on Beet's for selling the stuff!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I've been going here for the past six months or so and have yet to have a bad meal.  The owner is a very nice woman and it's a great place to have lunch and catch up on the latest sports news as ESPN is usually on the large flat panels they have there.  

In terms of food I usually get the jumbo chicago dog combo ($7.00) which  fills me up.  I've also had the BBQ Beef which is also great.  Being a Chicago native myself, I appreciate the good food this place provides at a great price.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>They just recently open up two locations near me and they are always very busy with the excitement of the new food. Don't let the lines worry you they move pretty quick. They have a lovely assortment of treats as well as sandwiches, soups, and breads. I had the tuna, it was not to my particular liking but I tried a little of everyone else's soups and sandwiches and all were very tasty. The menu is large with many options to chose from so grab a menu while standing in line to help with your decisions. You can also call ahead or use the drive thru :)</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Fantastic experience from start to finish! Inviting atmosphere and friendly service.  Smoked salmon appetizer was savory perfection.  Chopped salad was a fun twist with excellent flavors, not your average salad. The shrimp and grits are amazing with a touch of spice, the best I've ever had.  I am excited to have such a great new go to spot in the Camelback corridor. I will definitely be back again and again!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>How To UYE: Bingo With Khatherine T. and the Yeeps

-First, have dinner at the designated restaurant.  My first experience with UYE Bingo, we dined at Sushi House Goyemon. Last night, we ate at Cornish Pasty.  It was my first time at both establishments and so far have been delicious ways to kick off game night.

- Trek over to the South Point Casino and head up to the bingo hall on the second floor, near the movie theaters.  We've been going to the 9:00pm game on Saturday nights, so we've arrived around 8:30pm to get in line and purchase the necessities.  Khatherine always tells me what to do since I am no bingo expert.  I get the small rainbow pack with double action; just repeat that phrase to the person at the window, give he/she your cash, and receive your pack of bingo sheets if you choose paper to daub or get a receipt if you choose the electronic machine that does all the work, no dauber required.  The first time I came to bingo, I used a dauber and found it to be a little stressful and not so fun when Christie O. was sitting next to me and playing on her cellphone while I tried to concentrate and find the numbers to daub.  I paid the extra $2 last night for the machine and had more fun because I got to take pictures, text my BFFs, order more drinks, look around at all the bingo players (who are a motley bunch), and wait for my machine to sing to me. It must have had laryngitis because it didn't, but I'm not going to give up hope.  Whenever Khatherine hosts bingo night, you should join in the fun.  The first time I went, no one in our group won, but last night Sylvia Q. and Ife A. had machines that sung to them, which meant that they were winners!  

- Last tip:  you are supposed to actually yell, "BINGO!" loudly if you win.  If you do not, one of the South Point bingo crew will admonish you for failing to do so.  Waving your hands in the air like you just don't care or twerking are apparently not acceptable methods of telling everyone that you are a winner.
Hope to see you at the next UYE!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Texaz Grill was recomended to me by a friend and I was not dissappointed!  The atmosphere is that of the late 70's and it looks like nothing has been done to it since.  You get the feeling that you're eating in a roadhouse bar.  The steaks are cooked to order and you won't pay more than $20 for one either.  The portions are so generous I wasn't able to finish my meal.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Buldogi's Cafe just opened 2 weeks ago, and I would suggest going NOW as this place is going to get busy FAST. Really friendly cashier who explained the menu items before helping us to order. It's fusion food, a blend of Asian, Mexican, and American tastes. There was citrus-water which was ice water infused with lemon and lime, which I thought was a cool touch. 

Decided on the Hawaiian hot dog, Angry hot dog, and carne asada fries. The fries were monstrous, but nothing too special. The hot dogs, however, are definitely something to write home about. The Hawaiian dog contained a crispy-on-the-outside-juicy-on-the-inside hot dog topped with savory pork slices, ample amounts of green onion, some slaw and a super delicious sauce wrapped in a fluffy bun. The Angry dog had the same hot dog but spicy peppers and an even spicier sauce. Oh mama. 

Super clean facilities, very friendly staff and cooks, and most importantly, awesome food     at a great price. I will definitely be back, maybe to try the breakfast items!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>25-year old plus balsamic is a sauce unto itself. The basic version goes well on anything from veggies to meat to yogurt (seriously!). The fig balsamic you could eat with a spoon, and the other flavors are just as good. They're so good I give bottles to friends and family as birthday gifts and they've all thanked me. You cannot do better than to go with Bistro Blends!!!

As an aside, they do ship anywhere in the country, and I wouldn't get my balsamic anywhere else.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The interior is completely redone and it looks nice. Lots of tvs, granite bar tops, nice tables and they still have the pool table! They have a great happy hour everyday and their menu is extensive. I ordered the wings, GAP combo (choice of pizza and salad 8$) and my boyfriend had the American sliders.
The pizza was the best. I got chicken pesto and the dough was soo good. The wings were crispy, which I like. The fries are fresh you can tell they make them from scratch. The sauce on the sliders was different, I'm not sure how I feel about it. the waitress/bartender was super friendly and always kept my drink filled. She also remembered what I liked, which was nice.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>2010's Good Food restaurant of the year in Scotland and contender on Gordon Ramsey's best restaurant quest in the French category.

Came here for lunch, there was a simple but varied set menu at a very reasonable price. The food is delicious and the staff are very tentative and know what they are talking about.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Normally I love Del Taco, so I figured I would try out their breakfast burrito before a road trip up north. Bad call.

First of all, I had to repeat my order three times. Breakfast burrito meal with coffee. Not a tough one, and no special order.

When I get up to the window, the guy tells me they are out of hot coffee. WHA? It's 9am. However, he said they can give me an iced vanilla coffee instead. Sure, fine, whatever.

I hand over my debit card and what do you know, they are charging me to use it. Great. I am now paying 23% more because they are cheap-scates.

I get my bag of food and pull away, only to find out that I didn't get the meal.. I got a coffee and the burrito, but no hash brown sticks. BOO! Well, I am certainly not going back to try and explain myself, especially since I already scraped my tire trying to get closer to the window that is 5 feet away from the curb.

Oh, and to top it all off, the burrito and the coffee were gross.

No way, jose.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>PROS:
Great food, friendly service, large &amp; diverse menu, reasonable prices

CONS:
Small seating area

REVIEW:
My husband and I get takeout from Chicago Gyros on a regular basis.  We've had their gyros, gyro plate, souvlaki, humus, and french fries.  Their gyros are great!  They fill them with plenty of meat and the tzatziki sauce is delicious (we usually order extra).  The humus is also delicious - it has a sort of smokey flavor and is moist.  We only got souvlaki once and it was a little dry for our taste.  The fries were pretty standard.

Overall, we think it's a great place.  We like the food and the prices are reasonable.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>First of all, go to Carl's JRs main website, and see if they have any coupons. Most of the time, they have buy one, get one (s).

It was dead when I pulled up to the drive thru. However, Alyssa, who took my order, was beyond sweet and helpful.

I ordered 2 $6 thickburgers, and yes, they are actually $6. No false advertising there.

3 chicken strips with honey mustard

Criss cut fries, and a small sweet potato fry.

Everything I had was fresh, (as fresh as it could be) I saw them drop it in the fryer.

When I got home, our burgers were nicely wrapped, forgive my sloppy picture, that is not CJs doing. The burger is the best that I have had from a fast food joint. Hands down.

The only complaint I have, which makes my review 4stars is the chicken tenders. They were very small. And when 3 of them is close to $4, I thought I would be getting a little bit more. Especially when some of the sweet potato and criss cut fries were the size of my palm.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>So glad we decided to check out this new restaurant! We went for lunch so it didn't end up being super crowded. The service was amazing- our drinks were constantly full.  The guacamole was fantastic and if you order one thing on the menu, seriously, make it the street corn. That stuff is unreal. The tacos we tried, Baja and Pollo en Mole, were good but nothing to write home about. Our only complaint was the music. We didn't think it was too loud like other yelpers suggest, but it they were playing sad, slow country ballads. Not exactly what I would think of for their atmosphere and definitely not my preferred genre.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We so wanted to love Keader's. We've been waiting for them to open for weeks. Hopefully tonight's experience can be chalked up to being very new. 

My chicken panini would have been just ok, without too much flavor, but they packed it straight off the press naked into a plastic to go box. Without anything absorbent in there, the bread was soaking wet when I got home to eat. This has got to be just a rookie mistake, right?

The mushroom Brie soup was delicious and the bowl was pretty big too. 

The triple cheese cauliflower tasted like mild cheddar and flour. Not terrible by any means, but I was hoping for a little more sophistication. 

The chop chicken salad is in my fridge, I'll try it later. Looks fine. 

The two soups and salad all came with a side of bread, and after talking options and suggestions with the voice at the drive thru, we came up with three breads to try. Unfortunately the bag at home only contained the ciabatta. Ciabatta is fine but it was the least interesting of the three, and was looking forward to trying a variety of the breads. 

This place is RIGHT down the street from my house and open until ten, so I'll probably eventually give them another shot. I really hope tonight's wrinkles have been ironed out by then.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Star Liquor really epitomizes the neighborhood liquor store. It's selection isn't the largest in Madison, but it's still very good in beer, liquor, and I'm guessing wine as well (I haven't bought wine there yet, hence my reason for not drawing conclusions just yet). The prices are reasonable, and the staff is helpful. Pretty much a great place to purchase wine, beer, or liquor.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I went to OT's for lunch the other day and had a good experience.  Although I've lived and/or worked near the 24th and Camelback  area for several years now, this was my first time in.  I finally went because my dining companion suggested we meet there.  

Service was attentive and it was the perfect place for a business lunch.  I had the Oriental Chicken Salad and they accommodated my request for holding the wontons and adding avocado.  I liked that it included mango and the miso dressing was delicious!  My friend had the french onion soup to start and the BBQ Pulled Pork Panino sandwich.  He seemed to enjoy it.  He picked up the bill (lucky me), but I think it was moderately priced - maybe even a bit expensive for what we received.  The portions were not huge and we were not offered a bread basket that I recall.

Regardless, this was ideal for our lunch meeting...  we didn't have to wait and we could hear each other speaking.  They validate your parking in the garage so it's pretty convenient as well.  I'd like to go back on a Friday or Saturday night to experience their live entertainment and perhaps another selection from their dinner menu... but until then, 3 stars is the rating I give to OT's.  It was good - nothing more, nothing less!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>You are on your way back from seeing Hoover dam/ Boulder dam 
( a must stop on the Vegas travel itinerary) and you are hungry.
You see the railroad pass casino.
The sign that catches your eye is 7.99 T-Bone Steak Special. 
It just says OLD style VEGAS.
and ....you are hungry.
Looking like a white glorified truck stop as evidenced by all the "big rigs" parked in the lot - the Railroad Pass Casino looks is if it is built right into the hillside.
It has easy access from the highway.
Inside - your vision of "truck stop" is slightly augmented by the slot machines and few blackjack tables.
You make your way  past Leroy's sports book and you find the Iron Rail cafe....... Old style Vegas.
Nothing fancy, just comfortable booths and tables.
The T bone steak is very good and the whole experience says "old style Vegas."
The real secret in the Railroad Pass Casino is the Conductors Room - a very nice dining area with supurb Prime Rib, but since it was not open, the Iron Rail will do.
Nostalgic ...... and very nice food - the steak was large, cooked very well and that baked potato came in its own silver foil.
Totally enjoyable ....   
For the price - absolutely enjoyable.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I used this service in May 2014 for a Friday night. I had a group of 8, mixed M/F. I texted Nick that AM, got confirmation for limo pick up and comp entry to Light. 

Limo arrived right on time and took us over to drop off at Light. Only recommendation for limo is to tip $5/person. Nick, the host, met us right at the drop off. We were inside the club within 5 minutes, free entry for all if us and bypassed a HUGE line. 

Great service, it's legit. Try it out!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The food is homemade/authentic and you can tell. Definitely a breath of fresh air from all the MSG-flavored food in the other UW plaza Chinese restaurants.

Would agree with the other review that the dumplings did not have enough soup/juice but they were otherwise perfect. Another thing is the menu is fairly limited in selection.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Was in the mood for a TJ Hot Dog on my way home so I deiced to drive through Sunny Slope and look for a push cart. No such luck but I did happen upon this place in a Food City strip mall. Upon entering and looking over the menu I asked if they sold TJ Hot Dogs.. he told me why they didn't.. that doesn't make sense to me. He said that the ingredients to make TJ Hot Dogs would push out his Chicago style ingredients in his prep area.. I'm sorry but if you are in a largely Hispanic neighborhood and want to survive, feed the locals! Besides there are loads of Chicago dog places and only street carts for TJ Dogs.. I think he would make a fortune pimping TJ Dogs and Mexican beer!! 

Took about 10 minutes to get my dog, Chicago Style.. was so-so.. it had a way to generous amount of celery salt making the dog well, salty. Also the dog was on the smallish size but for the price I guess that was fine.

Probably wouldn't go back.. though very friendly business owners.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Haha...I think a)Thomas S. went on a bad day, or b) the cute little Asian couple that owned it when I used to patronize the place over 2 years ago, have sold.

While naming a hot dog "Chicago-style" or whatever never really seems to me to change the fact that...well, it's still just a hot dog under all them fancy condo-ments, I've never been disappointed. Granted, never been overly impressed either.

But I think I felt a familial love because whenever I'd pull into the itty bitty parking lot at the front of the store and walk in, the little guy would be like, "Ehhhhhhh, it's the PLINCESS". (He meant 'Princess' cause I had a window sticker sprawled across the windshield of my Black Jeep that read "Ebony Princess". I think he thought my sticker referred to Yours Truly. And in a way, he'd be right)

But Whoa, I digress. Ugly 70's basement decor aside, they're definitely not the worst hot dog place in the valley! And luckily I've never had Thomas' experience.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I'm giving 5-stars to this Walgreen's for the exemplary service I received at the drive-through pharmacy today.

First of all, let me say that my pharmacy experience is colored by the typically lousy experience I get at the Fry's Marketplace pharmacy near my house. In the case of Fry's, they typically ignore you when you come to the window, take 40-minutes to fill any prescription - even something that's in a box and all they have to do is pull it off the shelf. I've even had them take 40-minutes and then tell me that they were out of the medicine and I needed to go to another store.

Enough about Fry's - eventually I'll write a review of them - and back to today's tremendous experience at Walgreen's.

Because my in-law's are currently out of town, I agreed to pick up a prescription for my wife's grandmother and deliver it to her nursing home. My mother-in-law told me that I could just go through the drive-through and get it. Unfortunately, when I got there it turned out the refill had never been ordered. 

Luckily, the pharmacist looked in the computer, determined the needed medication, put in the refill and told me it would be ready in 20-minutes.

I took my kids to run another errand and then came back to the store. When we came back to the drive-through, the first pharmacist still couldn't find the prescription in the system. However, instead of giving me the brush-off, as the would have at Fry's, she went and found the pharmacist I had talked with 20-minutes earlier. As it so happened, that pharmacist was in the midst of filling the prescription and they had the medication to me in less than 5-minutes.

Despite the fact that Fry's is just around the corner, I may be transferring the family prescriptions to Walgreen's. It's a nice change to deal with people who actually make the extra effort and who seem to care,</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We stopped here on a Badger hockey game day, just a few days after they opened. No new restaurant growing pains here! Plenty of knowledgeable and friendly staff, and some of the coolest ambiance in Madison. Industrial feel with repurposed pipes &amp; gears, and faucets as coat hooks. Loved it.

The owner greeted us upon arrival and gave us the low down on their menu. Traditional sausages like dogs and brats, and some specialty sausages based on foods they love to eat, plus a guest sausage from a local chef. Check out the menu for yourself - so many options! Nice beer selection - served in mason jars which was fun. New Glarus Black Top for him, Hacker-Pschorr wheat for her.

We started with the fried chz curds (only $4!!), which were, in our professional curd eating opinions, some of the best that we had ever eaten. We ended up getting three orders total in our group. Local curds from the owners home town of Monroe, fried to perfection. You can get them with ranch, honey mustard or Siracha mayo. We chose ranch, which was nice and thick and very tasty.

On to the sausages...we both decided to go with the Bahn Mi sausage. Vietnamese pork sausage: pickled veggies, cilantro, jalapeños, chili-mayo. Just the right amount of spice (especially good with beer) and crunch. Per the hubby, the pork sausage melted in his mouth. I'm not a meat eater, but OSS gives the option of subbing in a vegan sausage into any of their specialty sausages with made me quite happy! I immediately recognized the three vegan flavor options (chipotle, Italian, smoked apple &amp; sage) to likely be Field Roast brand sausages. I got the Italian. I've never had an awesome vegan sausage (&amp; I've tried and tried and tried to find one), and Field Roast is about the best I've had, so it was a good choice on their part, but it would be great to see someone out there try to make a decent tasting veggie sausage! In this case, the toppings were so fantastic, and the perfect pairing to any sausage, that I was ecstatic with the whole experience.

We rounded out the meal with their hand cut french fries. Just like the curds, they were fried to perfection. Obviously fresh, peel on, and just great, great, great.

There are so many sausages to try, we will DEFINITELY be going back. It made us nostalgic for Italian sausages at the outdoor beer garden on Badger football game day at Josie's Restaurant that used to sit on this same spot. OSS will absolutely kill it on game day! The waitress kept going outside ( less than 10 degrees out!) with free samples of curds, drawing people in. This place is going to be packed once the word gets out!! The staff told us that we were their first 8 top table - biggest group that they'd had so far...we were so proud. :)</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I live across the street from this Applebee's, and I've been going there for years.  terrific service almost every time -- sometimes I've even called the manager over to COMPLIMENT the server.  

The decor is kinda casual laidback sports bar.

It's a neighborhood chain folks:  Don't go there expecting the it to be like the Ritz or the Biltmore.  A steak dinner here only costs $10-$12 bucks.  And for that price, it's surprisingly good!!!  I want my steak medium-rare (on the rare side), and that's how they serve 'em to me.  On the rare occasion that I'm dissatisfied, I ask 'em to "repair the damage" and they do it immediately - and with an apology and a friendly smile.

The first time I at here I really liked it, and I told my 'rents.   They wouldn't even try it.  Took me weeks to convince them to walk in the door.  Then, they decided to eat at this Applebee's 3 - 5 nights a week!  And, sometimes they did eat at the Ritz, so they knew the diff.

As far as I'm concerned, for a neighborhood chain restaurant, Applebee's is just fine, thank you very much!</review:review_text>

Fantastic fish fry. I need to go there for the Italian food. Oh yeah, the transvestites sitting at the next table was a new one. Your Adam's Apples compliment your dresses. Hey creepy...</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Really cute cafe in Antiques at the Market run by a chef hailing from New York City! The staff is super friendly and accommodating, and the food is really hearty and delicious! I would definitely recommend the signature burger - mac n cheese and bacon jam on a beef patty - what's not to love? I also enjoyed their mac n cheese in general, it's baked and crispy on the edges, yummmm. Other tasty dishes include the Brie and mushroom bruschetta, caramel bar, hummus, and so much more! Can't wait to visit again!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>"Too pricey, trendy, salty, slow and irrelevant."

Since my hometown is Kenosha (known as Little Brooklyn for a reason), the ability to determine the difference between phony and authentic Italian cuisine is pivotal for any hope to socially survive. 

When learning that we were heading over to Tutto's, their on-line menu was scoped. It read much like a snotty neo-trad Italian-style restaurant would; needless to share ... I was skeptical. 

Random samplings of pastas, pizzas and gnocchi increased my blood pressure 20%. The salt drenched dishes were over-seasoned and seemed to be an over-compensation for lean cuisine-sized portions. Although the crust, pasta and gnocchi seemed to be baked/cooked well, they were difficult to enjoy due to the salt dump. 

I would have asked for a redo, but the service was delinquent. In fact, we had to hunt down our server for the check. Considering the size of the group and the auto-factored gratuity %, the far from overwhelming flow of customer, the lack of service is unexplainable. 

On a positive note, the atmosphere was cute and was appropriate for the theme.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I seem to be going to Tom's Restaurant &amp; Tavern about every two weeks. where  I meet my friend for lunch.  I love this place and our main waiter, Frank, Jr.  not only is he so professional, courteous and funny, but  becomes your friend right away.  You would think you have known him forever.  Their food is delicious and they have a huge menu.  It's very nice because you can either choose to sit outside on the patio like a cafe' setting, or sit inside the restaurant.  They are reasonably priced and most of the people that eat there are on their lunch hour, so they do hurry to get your food out.  I highly suggest you try Tom's Restaurant and Tavern the next time you are down on Central Ave.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I've been wanting LASIK for years and this place was really close to where I live, so I checked them out first.  Long story short, they told me I was not a candidate for LASIK because of my high prescription.  Normally they'd recommend ICLs (implantable contact lenses) but the anterior chamber of my eyes were too shallow.  So they said there was nothing they could do for me and told me I was better off in contacts/glasses.  I was pretty discouraged until an optometrist friend of mine recommended getting several other opinions (she worked for a LASIK center that did eyes worse than mine) ... and I did.

Here's where I learned the truth of BDPEC... apparently within the local ophthalmologist community, they are FAMOUS for pushing ICLs.  So let me save you some time here.  If your near-sighted prescription is worse than -6.00, they will recommend ICLs (below that they will do LASIK).  FYI - ICLs cost a lot more than LASIK, too (ka-ching!).  Anyways, if you don't fit that ICL bucket, they'd rather let you walk.  After doing more research, I discovered that a high-prescription ALONE does not a bad LASIK patient make, which is what BDPEC led me to believe.  In fact, the other doctors told me that because my corneas are way above average in thickness, my risk for complications is much lower!  Imagine that!  

I'm sure that if you fit into the BDPEC business model, you will get great results.  However, I STRONGLY encourage anyone considering refractive correction surgery to do your research and get at least 2 or 3 opinions outside of BDPEC.  They operate on a business-first model vs. clinical-first.

Good luck!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The Teeter House is a trip, like no other. I was drinking with a couple of newly met friends next door at Rose and Crown and they wanted to go here to check it out, so I was a good sport about it. We tried sitting at the "bar" but the owner said we cant sit there, because thats the managers seat..... eh? I was definitely surprised to notice they have a full bar, but all the other aspects were very very odd. The plants in the bath tub, the victorian old lady wallpaper, and the same dining room table seats my parents had growing up in the 80's. Maybe it's my generation, but this place did NOT appeal to me whatsoever, and who tells their customers they aren't allowed to sit at the bar?</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I'm surprised that this place only has a handful of reviews, but I guess that happens when your regulars are a bunch of Yelp sales people who can't write reviews.

I frequent this establishment bi-weekly and always get a legit sando. Not too many Deli's in Phx that are that classic Deli/Convenient store combo like you find on every few corners in Cali, and this spot nails it. I usually stick with the Ham &amp; Turkey Club because their bacon kills it, nice and crispy, crunch.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>My first and only experience (to date) with George and Dragon was not very pleasant. When you walk in you are magically whisked away to an all-too-authentic British pub. That's great if what you are after is smelling like an ashtray after a meal of Shepherd's Pie. 

The waitress that served me seemed a little brusque. Maybe that's part of the restaurant's "charm"?  The bathroom was in a transitory state of disrepair... or at least I hope it was transitory. I wasn't even sure if I was supposed to be in there.

Televisions are available for watching the soccer match and they have many types of beer on tap. I noticed a jukebox but didn't turn it on for fear of being pummeled severely by the other gruff-looking patrons while the soccer match was on.

This place has a little bit of an edge to it. If that's what you're into and you're just looking for a spot to grab a beer with a buddy, then check it out for sure. I'm not sure when or if I'll be back again, personally.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Place was new so we decided to check it out. After coming off an Asian trip, I thought American food sounded good.

The Cheddar's Pain Killer was a nice drink to start us off. Along with the Wisconsin cheese bites (addictive) and chips and queso (good). 

Our server warned us that their portions were large here and we did notice a few to-go bags leaving while we were waiting, so we kept that in mind when ordering our main dish. Between our family we tried the baby back ribs (ok), chicken tenders (ok), Sweet Heat Chicken &amp; Shrimp (a joke), Top Sirloin Steak (so rubbery it was painful to eat), and the smokehouse burger (good but regular size).

We noticed that in no way did any of the portions seem "large" in comparison to any other restaurants I've been to, so not sure why that was emphasized by our waiter.

All-in-all, this is typical chain-style American food. The drink I had was good, the meal I had was forgetable. The value wasn't there either. We all agreed we wouldn't return.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>It's been robbed on 2 different occasions while I was shopping there.

I go to the one at Osborn and 7th Ave now.

Better selection, bigger store, cleaner, safer.

EDIT

+1 STAR

One redeeming value - Good place to flirt with hipster girls buying hummus or whatever. At least until her girlfriend returns with the chocolate chip cookies and kicks your ass.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>King's Balti has established itself as a great place to eat in Edinburgh in my mind, and this is only after one visit.

I have to concur with Jonathan's review in one sense.  The food that we had was superb.  We were a group of between 25 and 30, there for a stag party, and we were accommodated without any issue.  I had a standard chicken korma, which was creamy and delicious.  Having sampled small amounts of other people's food, it was all superb.

I had a different experience to Jonathan regarding the service however.  I found their service to be, on the whole, excellent.  The waiting staff engaged us in conversation throughout the evening, often coming in to enjoy a joke or quick chit-chat.  With a lively bunch of men like we were, this added to the atmosophere, and we all left the restaurant as satisfied customers.  All our needs were attended to throughout the evening.  Perhaps going back with just a few people would yield a different result.

Although the location on Buccleuch Street is perhaps slightly off the beaten track, I feel that it's worth taking the time to visit King's Balti.  Maybe you'll be able to provide another review of their service here on Yelp?</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Fancy El Pedgregal location, yet the food was mediocre at best.  Portions were a bit small.  French toast came out at almost room temperature.  Prices were high, as if this was a full service place but it isn't.  Nearly all typical breakfast items on the menu except for pancakes, which seemed a bit odd.  Everything but pancakes.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Just stopped in here with my kids and grand baby yesterday and did we ever have fun. The pizza is great, sauce is amazing. I dreamed about the wings last night....the sweet hot are to die for. The kids had a blast playing Nintendo chess and pool, the owners are cheerful, attentive, and aim high to please. Mission accomplished. We will be back!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Would give zero stars if i could! Over ten dollars for four doughnuts? No prices listed. No descriptions listed. And the doughnuts were so GREASY! You could taste it. My hand was covered in it. We didnt even finish them, just tossed them out. Will never go back. Go to Pinkbox instead!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Food is okay. Most of the menu seems high priced. Service is inconsistent. One day it's great and another day it's bad. If the service was exceptional all the time the high menu prices wouldn't be as noticeable. Happy hour is okay with discounts on drafts, drinks and appetizers (bar only). They have about a dozen televisions in the bar plus trivia, and karaoke.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>First and forest, the layout of the resturant is very nice and clean. In essance, there is plenty of chairs and tables to conform to any size of party with just enough decorations to mold the upbeat atmospohore of the resturant. Additionally, the staff is extremely friendly with nothing but a sincere attitude and smile on their faces. Besides the great layout and friendly staff the food itself is what will have me coming back for more ! We ordered a gyro in pita with french fries. Normally, I'm very picky when it comes to what  I eat; normally I don't deviate from anything that isn't a hamburger.  However, the gyro was absolutely delicious.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Great place in Madison to find top notch wines and cigars.  The cigar humidor is huge with a fantastic selection.  And when you find the one you want, sit down, light it up and enjoy!  About the only place in Madison you can do that at.  They also have some really nice tasting events where you can try out a variety of wine, scotch and cigars.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>You need a good Chinese delivery wherever you go. This has become ours, in Madison. 

We tried 3 or 4 others - including Rubys - and none of them could pass our litmus: it must be able to produce a decent General Tso's Chicken that isn't too sweet or gooey with a modicum of heat, the egg rolls must be fried in clean oil and we should never see canned vegetables. 

So far, they have satisfied. The General Tso's is by far better than anything we have come across in Madison - and no, the chicken has not been spoiled for us. The battered coating before fry is not too heavy and the sauce has a little bit of heat. Personally I would like more chilis, but I realize that is an acquired taste. 

Mu Shui style pork with plum sauce and pancakes has been fine, not dry and overcooked, and no sight of canned vegetables. Cold sesame noodles were the lightly dressed vinegar kind, not the peanut butter sauce kind. But they were fresh, not gloopy. Looking forward to trying other dishes on the menu but so far, it's been good. This has made us very happy, since we have always enjoyed Asian cuisines wherever we have lived (San Francisco, New York) and Madison seemed to have been devoid of decent Cantonese/Hunan/Szechuan style Chinese food. 

Sure, it isn't Wu Leng Yi but it is quite adequate for those long work days when you get home and just don't want to cook. Delivery is always within 20 minutes even though they say 40.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I don't usually write reviews but today I decided this place was worth one :)
   
 I just got the 12 piece chicken meal for the family and I have to say, it was delicious!
Chicken was crispy, not greasy at all, coleslaw was awesome. Kids loved the mac and cheese and biscuits ( I don't eat them ) but they said it was great. Also got an order of he butterfly shrimp which was delicious.  Definitely worth going back for!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>So apparently not all GNC's are created equally. This place does not have the same prices as the GNC at Mesa River view. Pretty lame right? I thought so as well and why does GNC make their employees wear ties? Pretty lame considering those guys make about $8 per hour.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Service is extremely subpar.  They messed up our order and we didn't notice until we got home.  Called to inform them of the mix-up and asked that they have our original order ready in 10 minutes as I drove back.  The woman on the phone didn't apologize and abruptly asked, "Have you eaten the meal?"  No, I just got home.  "You must bring back the meal that was wrong."  Huh?  I'm fine with that, but what will you do with it?  Re-serve it?  Feed animals?  Odd.  Of course my order wasn't ready when I returned.  I turned over the erroneous order.  Then another worker asked how she could help me...I informed her that my order was mixed up.  She said, "Well did you bring back the meal that was given to you?"  Yes, the other server just took it.  It was another 10 minutes before I received the correct order.  No offer of a refund.  No offer of a free piece of cake.  No sincere apology.  Crandall's---your food is good, but your service is simply awful.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Long line up on opening day! There were free samples of various milk teas and cupcakes. 

Would recommend the Grass Jelly Roasted Milk Tea, it has more flavour. :) The milk tea is good, but I think you can get better value at Noon Moment down the street.... cheaper, just as good and shorter line.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Tonya and I apparently eat at all the same restaurants! I frequently see her new reviews and am reminded of them as places I need to review...

With that, I have eaten at both Chautara and Himal Chuli and I think both are excellent. Chautara is more expensive, boasts a more sophisticated environment and somewhat more upscale food. Personally, I prefer Himal Chuli, but that's because I love dives, and I like that I can go up and attempt to communicate with the little Nepalese woman cooking my food in the small, cramped kitchen. 

In that kind of place, I'm not looking for amazing service, so it doesn't bother me that they are friendly without being overly attentive. I have had a great lunch at Chautara too though. The service, food and atmosphere were excellent. Both restaurants are great places to find uncommon cuisine that appears to be very authentic. Adventurous eaters who desire a somewhat upscale experience will definitely love Chautara.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>HA ha! Gay Denny's natch! lmao! This place is awesome!!

In the daytime you can see several groups of people thinking about their would-be purchases in the near by car dealerships. But in the night time...

late night, say... 2AM-ish... this place comes to LIFE! The patrons of the nearby clubs and bars conviene here to get their late night munchies on! There's some major people watching going on!! 

Go and hang out, scope out the MUCH smaller late night menu and have fun. :)</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I get takeout from China Inn a couple times a month on average. So far everything I've had has been pretty good.

I'm a big fan of their Mongolian Beef.  The beef and chicken fried rice is good as well. The only complaint I have is sometimes the Mongolian beef is more onions than beef. Maybe that's because I go there later in the evening shortly before closing time and I get what's left of the beef.

I don't eat in, but I can describe the restaurant decor as your typical tacky Chinese restaurant decorations like the ceramic Fat Buddhas and ceramic lucky cats on the counters. The dining room is pretty much the same- Chinese fans on the wall, etc.

I'd visit China Inn more often if the prices were a bit lower. Combo meals like the Mongolian beef with an eggroll, cream cheese wontons, and fried rice for one runs $10 with no drink. A bit pricey compared to something like Panda Express.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>First time here for pizza and salad
The only thing I knew before walking in was I know it's take home pizza...

The employees were very friendly and helpful, they executed their jobs perfectly
It's a good thing I went on a Tuesday because they have a $10 Large pizza deal which was perfect for me 
I got a Large pizza split in half
Half was just cheese and sauce (boring)
The other half was papa's favorite
Papa's favorite consists of sauce, cheese, pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, mushrooms, onions, green peppers, and black olives...
Sooooo good! 

I also got a regular garden salad with ranch and the whole thing was about $14

The guy making my pizza (Brandon) was very nice and filled me in on the heating instructions as well as tips for my next visit

The pizza is super good and the salad is good as well :) 

Ps- next time I want to try the cookie dough and/or the dessert pizzas</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>So far so good (and spicy) so I'll definitely be back. It's a spacious restaurant. Staff is uber friendly. I didn't catch his name but he was a pretty cool server.

First off, we got the hotpot combo. You get 4 items at 5 pieces each and it soaks in the hotpot broth. There's no mild for this so we got the second option in terms of spice levels (3 total). He says it doesn't soak up the spice much in a short time span, but the tofu SOAKS it up well. So, beware, if you can't take much spice like me.

Aside from that we only got the lamb skewers. I'll be back for other stuff. Now, for the lamb skewers, we got mild, because frankly, I don't want to die burning.

So, guess what? I died burning. It was soooooooooooooooo spicy!!!!!!! WHY?! Because they were trying a new spice or new manufacturer (or something of the like) and it was WAY too spicy. It wasn't just us. I believe the staff tried it as well as the table next to us. Yeah, it was death by the burning of my tongue and I was wishing for milk (of course, they didn't have it). BURN BURN BURN.

Anyway, they gave us a new stock of lamb skewers. No spice ;).

Owner came over and apologized and explained the situation. No biggie. He's a pretty nice guy. Explained their VIP cards, too. Right now it's $20 until the end of April. So, if you think you'll be coming often, grab one before the prices go up. It's pretty much where they offer different deals per day and each day offers a different item.

For example, you could get a BOGO (for example, BOGO crab) one day. You could get 10% off the whole bill. And so forth. I don't remember every one that he listed but feel free to ask any of the servers. :)

While the experience wasn't excellent for my first time, it was handled well. And I will definitely be back. ^^V</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Having recently turned vegetarian for health reasons, I wondered if the Paneer Tikka Masala could be half as good as their Chicken Tikka Masala, which was the best I've had from England to NYC to Phx. Well, no need to worry because it was superb! Smooth and creamy, the dish melts in your mouth. There are numerous vegetarian options. I strongly suggest samosas to start, and you can't go wrong with their saag/palak, chana masala, either of the dahls, the yummy okra dish, or the aloo gobi with savory cauliflower and potatoes. Add rice and garlic naan and you will have a delicious  meal. Take some home too cuz it's even better the next day!  Friendly and courteous staff, and the owner usually stops by every table.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Ah, a slice of Americana dining. Sometimes we all have a hankering for some grease-soaked fires ( or onion rings, as the case may be ) and want to slosh it down with some frothy root beer. 

I had one of those moments this weekend while crossing back into Vegas from Arizona. And, lo, and behold, there, looming on the edge of town, A &amp; freakin' W! We were jonesing for the tangy taste of an A &amp; W float since we first passed it going OUT of town. Now was our chance to relive the childhood memories of hopping into the Vista Cruiser Station Wagon and heading out for some grease and sugary drinks. 

The person who designed the parking lot should be flogged. If they are still alive. It looks like a model T chugging along at 20 mph would navigate the maze well, but not so for any modern conveyance. 

The cute and homely front counter gal was all bubbles and smiles. Hell, ALL the employees were downright cheerful. But I was feeling vertigo as the ordering counter was at a bizarre angle to the seating, so I ordered my Float ( of course ) and an order of fries and rings and staggered out into the dining area. 

Seating was a definite problem. Actually the lack of seating more the problem. The place was chock full of families with their kids in various levels of sports uniform disarray. It almost looked like a munchkin football convention. 

This wasn't bad. What was bad was the table of people who could have been transported back to 1977 and would have been sporting sideburns, Village people porno mustaches, feathered hair, Angel Flights, and have come in from their black and gold Trans Ams. Transport them to now: wearing Juicy Couture purses, stone washed jeans, Ed Hardy shirts, and House of Pain Fighting Irish gear with the brim sideways. You get the picture. More than once, I wanted to lean over and ask, "hey, what are you in for?". They were loud, obnoxious, and they fit in perfectly with the artery-hardening fast food. 

And what was really crazy was the single restroom that caused a major backup at the rear of the establishment. It was utter chaos there. And wouldn't you know it, that was exactly the only area to grab a table. And it was also right next to the po boy trailer park crowd. 

No freaking wonder the drive-thru was so damned busy. Take a clue, drive-thru. only. 

I'll do this again in five years after my memories has dimmed somewhat. Colorful, boisterous, quaint, but not quiet. If only the A &amp; W root beer wasn't so danged good.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Best BBQ I've ever had. On the same level as Phil's BBQ in San Diego... don't mind the lines, service is fast and the line moves quick. I love the way they lay out drinks before you order. They have 312 and IBC in stock, AWESOME!

The 1/2lb ordering system takes some getting used to. In my opinion, 1/2lb of ribs/prime rib is not enough for most men. Order a pound, don't be a wuss. The 1/2lb of brisket is plenty, however. Perfect amount of food. 

Only side I have tried so far was coleslaw and it was meh. Plain, boring. Would not order again... but considering how great everything else is (including the service!) I won't dock any stars :)

The moist brisket is the thing to try first, it will sell you on this place! I can't wait to go back and try the chicken and corn on the cobb (you get a whole cobb!).</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Well folks, I did the chain thing. I confess. Rickie and I had spent and exhausting day (and a quick $200) at Target and were thinking steaks. The budget didn't include Morton's or Ruth's Chris. I had brain freeze and forgot the local spots I love so much that grill a mean meat (i.e. Phoenix City Grill), so the first restaurant past Target that fit the bill was our local Applebee's on Camelback and Central. Mind you, I don't expect a decor marvel or a hostess so hip it hurts. I know what i'm getting myself into. For the most part. But I had recently seen a TV commercial from Applebee's and of course the food was airbrushed so perfectly like Celine Dion's face on the current issue of HELLO magazine. I mean, really, Celine, you have no wrinkles even after living in Las Vegas these past couple of years? Anyhoo, we were greeted and seeted promptly by a teenager who definitley just had a smoke and could use a visit to the tanning booth. Once seated, our server, Mo, took our drink and appetizer order and quickly disappeared. For quite awhile. Cue the Jeoporady theme music. Once our iced teas and the new appetizer (tuscan cheese bread extravangza) arrived we sipped and dipped. Not bad.Raspberry tea with an univited yet delighted visit by vanilla and the cheese spread was rich and yummy served with a spot of diced tomato, basi and garlic...aka bruscetta. NICE. We ordered onion chips, like an onion loaf or the blooming onion at Outback....they were good. Two sauces for our dipping pleasure...one your typical ranch, the other a sort of spiced up thousand island with horseradish. Then the entrees arrived. Cue the creepy dum, dum, dum, music...Both NY strip steaks over cooked to such an extreme. The asparagus was limp like, well, let's just say it reminded me of a Vietmanese gymnast I once dated who didn't take the little blue pill. Sides included mashed potatoes (loaded) which means bacon, cheese and sour cream. Ok, Ok, Ok, too much of the extras. What ladle in the kitchen did they pick to put these extras on my mashed potatoes? All in all, I had low expectations at this venue, and they were met. Shout out to Mo the server, a good gal! The clientele was like a scene out of Dawn of the Dead. Sorry. Lesson learned...Applebee's ok some of the time. Get an app and a drink. Skip the entrees. Be nice to a nice server. And for God's sake don't expect a steak worthy of the big chain peeps.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>It was off to a slow start, I kept track of how long it took to get our tacos by my check in time and it took 44 minutes to get our 6 tacos. But the staff was apologetic and made sure we were okay so no problem. I understand that since they just opened Tuesday, that  they probably haven't gotten a quick system going yet but I'm sure they'll be faster next time. 
Their beer menu is pretty impressive, I forgot to count but it looked like 6 pages of beer selections and cocktails to choose from. One thing I was a little sad about, no horchata :( I must have horchata  with my tacos!!! Maybe even make an alcoholic version! Lol 
The main thing that makes their tacos stand out is the tortilla! Not too thick or thin, freshly handmade and had perfect texture! Delicious! The guacamole and chips also tasted really fresh and it was a pretty big portion. We ordered 2 pork al pastor, 2 carne asada, 1 beef adobado, and 1 chicken tinga. Oh my, I will definitely be back for the al pastor, it was perfect! The pineapple with the pork and the perfect tortilla, heaven! The carne asada was a little lacking in the seasoning, the adobado had a good flavor to it and so did the chicken tinga. 
The pricing was also  great! Our total bill was $39 for 6 tacos, a cocktail, and guacamole with chips. I will definitely be back to try the other tacos and flan and fingers crossed that it'll be quicker next time! If it is, 5 stars :)</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place should get five stars for their chips and salsa alone,. The chips are fresh-made flour rather than corn (I am usually more of a corn tortilla person, but these are delicious).  The salsa is a green chili salsa that leaves a slow burn in your mouth that makes it hard to quit eating.

I have been here twice now.  The first time I ordered cheese enchiladas, which were good.  I noticed they had potato flautas on the second visit.  I used to love flautas when I ate meat and missed them when I went veg years ago.  I was stoked to finally find a place that served flautas stuffed with something other than meat.  They were good and topped with a very tasty guacamole. (I am sure that the meat ones are equally good if not better)  I look forward to trying the torta on the next visit.  (I returned for the torta a few days later and it is excellent as well.)

I am happy to have stumbled onto this place.  There are a number of small Mexican restaurants on this stretch of McDowell and I have been wanting to try some of them for awhile.  La Hacienda is right on the corner of 16th and McDowell. It has a unassuming appearance on the outside, other than its windows splashed with daily specials.  The interior is pretty cool though.  It is a lot more spacious than it looks on the outside.

  The wait can be a little longer than some places, even when it is not that busy.  Be prepared for a little lag on the service if you go and appreciate that you get to enjoy such good eats.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The food here is so mediocre as to be funny.  But the place itself holds a special place in my heart.  I spent many a high school half-day with my friends sitting in the trolley.  And I always loved the decor.  It was like walking into a mansion that is some old-timey wonderland.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Looks like I went to the wrong place. . .

I was hoping to go to the same Tee Pee Tap Room where the American Progressive band Cartoon first planned their compositions.  Apparently that was the OTHER Tee Pee Tap Room.

How was the food here?  Well, lets just say that we all know what The Great Cornholio does with "tee pee".

I ordered a two enchilada plate.  The refried beans tasted really fresh. . .from the can.  That was pretty much how the whole of the meal was.  It was edible, but not enjoyable.  I was hoping to have a decent meal in a place with some history, and instead I have a meal in the wrong restaurant that was on the bad side of mediocre.  There are many good Mexican restaurants in Phoenix.  The Tee Pee Tap Room (at least this place) is not one of them.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The food from here is freshly baked and all of good quality and also rather tasty.  In this respect it really delivers and you will be pleased with any purchase from here.

The prices are also fairly reasonable and better than many of this places competitors on like for like items making this place a winner in terms of choosing the best value for money place to buy your lunch or a quick snack from.

My only gripe is that after lunch time, you no longer get the same selection and I know it's about freshness and not wasting items, but in the afternoons you don't get a large amount of choice.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We were out on one of those warm summery days and found ourselves searching for a wee sandwich shop in the area. We had never heard of this place and decided to take a chance. The decor was brilliant! You feel like you are in a real french cafe! 
You could tell that they took their food seriously as well as they had very rare treats such as a special pate, and cheeses that you rarely see around. I am not very familiar with French food but wanted to try the ever so famous Croque Monsieur. Apparently these bad boys can go for 20 euros at the hotels in Paris!! Here however they are much more reasonably priced. 

Basically its an open faced sandwich (baguette) with bechamel and emmental cheese. Its grilled and the baguette gets a bit crunchy (Croque Monsieur means Mister crunchy in France), and the cheese toasted and even a bit burnt, which I love cause its crunchy on top yet bubbly and beautiful underneath. I asked that he put a bit of dijon and pepper on it which gave it a bit of kick. LOVED IT! 

They also have fresh squeezed orange juice which I have come to understand is quite difficult to come across in these northerly parts! I can't even tell you how many times I have asked the waiter if the orange juice was freshly squeezed and for them to tell me ye, yet  when I receive the juice it is clearly from the carton and not even tropicana quality! ugh. yes, this is a pet peeve of mine, but is it so hard to understand the concept of freshly squeezed juice???? Anyways, they do have it here and I love that. 

The price is reasonable and the place is quaint and delicious. They also offer student discounts (10% off).</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>A great addition to the neighborhood!! It must be tough selling Mexican food in this area- lots of good places to go. But, Lucha is one of the best. The recipes are the families originals. The food is very authentic and plentiful. Flavors are amazing!! Previous reviews have touched on the meats, variety and options available, so I will save you the reading. All the quicker to get over there!!!  Go!! Runnn!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>It's the typical Wallgreen's.  What I like is it is very close to our home and therefore very convenience when having a prescription filled.   

We also use this place to get our candy prior to going to a movie and at times there are some nice sales going on which make it even cheeper.   

At times they also have some nice selections when it comes to seasonal items such as Easter, Halloween and Christmas.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I've always had consistent quality of food and service here.  

Standard menu....everything is a la carte.  I've been to this specific location about half a dozen times....

I recommend City Hall or Mastro's (N. Scottsdale), over Morton's.  But between Fleming's and here, it's a tossup.  I would eat at either....but I would probably choose Fleming's over Morton's.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I have this strange problem with buffets.  The utter challenge of consuming such a massive quantity of food makes me instantaneously nauseous.  With apprehension, though I've attempted them often.
Strangely enough, I have this strange problem with Las Vegas as well.  I've never been much of a gambler, and the idea of immediately and constantly overstimulating my other senses seems just too damn overwhelming. 

So, combine the two and I'm pretty much destined to be disgusted.  The Firelight Buffet surprised me though. For a few bucks I was given the opportunity to slowly peruse "cuisine" from around the world.  While  most fare was standard and lacking real challenging flavor (c'mon its buffet food), I was impressed with both the freshness and variety that was presented. A "far east" counter featured quite tasty vegetable spring rolls while another, on the polar opposite side of a gigantic room of food, had farily decent tamales. Each plate I consumed was like a small trip around the world, and though I had no space in my stomach available, I could've continued my varied "culinary trip" for at least another couple of countries. I'll admit it: I was impressed with the total tonnage of food availability.  The atmosphere was quiet and serene, the service was fine, and I was even given alcohol as part of the deal.  

I left full and I left happy.  Sick, but pleasantly so.  Maybe I'll start playing bacarrat or something and rethink this whole Vegas thing. 

Additional Kudos and one extra star for the hand-scooped ice cream bar and the killer lazer light show complete with an animatronic coyote.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>In my particular area, we have an infestation of crickets and black widow spiders originating in our garage.  The professionals from Apple Exterminating told my wife they'd be at our place between 11-1. They were at my house at 11:20 ready to go.  The owner told me that his spray is safe, but has a smell to it.  He said it was a pepper smell, but to me it was similar to new carpeting. Either way, I found this service to be highly personable, knowledgeable, and professional. I felt absolutely no pressure to have them come monthly even though it was was mentioned in their pitch, although it would probably be a good idea.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The person who recommended this place either has very low culinary expectations or a perverted sense of humor. Both the tacky, threadbare decor and low price should have tipped us off to what lay in store for us - a spread that was mediocre at best, with food that was overcooked, underseasoned (except for salt . . . lots and lots of salt!), and lukewarm. Fatty, gristly meats, greasy chicken, canned vegetables, and wilted salad were among the better offerings, and strawberry jello was the best dessert. We felt like we had wandered into a pot luck supper in a white-trash trailer park. Each night has a different theme, but it seems unlikely they could pull off anything as exotic as spaghetti and meatballs or enchiladas. At $9.99, they're charging about $6 too much.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>this place is not bad, in fact i rather liked it. 
the prices are good and the food is decent. i rather go here than a big chain where i would pay more for similar food. 

There's a bar area and a section with tables. Definitely a mixed crowd-young singles, EMTs on a break, middle aged singles, older couples, and families. kinda cool. 

the Village Green offers new glarus and cap brewery on tap, as well as other stuff i cant remember. We were there on a Saturday night and my husband got the special, double cheeseburger with fries for $6.95. I just got the regular burger, and it was about $3.50. the burgers looked like the frozen variety, but they were kinda tasty, really.  

schlitz in a can $2 all the time, big screen tv

for me a downside was that the place was a little smoky, i guess there isn't a smoking ban in this city yet, however, it is possible to sit outside. 

the server was pleasant and efficient.

cash only</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Often at lunchtime I Google "food Madison" to give me inspiration for what I want to eat that day. Today I noticed this new restaurant just 1 block from where I work, so I checked it out. I was pretty excited because I've been missing having a hot dog/brat place to go to since Mad Dogs and Bison Jacks have both closed. 

First off, they accept cash only. I had to use the fee-free ATM located by the entrance. 

I wasn't feeling very adventurous today, so I ordered a grilled hot dog and the cheese curds that were raved about in the other posts. I like that the hot dog was grilled, but it wasn't worth the cost to me. I'd almost recommend they start using the soft, poppy-seed topped Chicago dog buns for the hot dogs to give it an added value besides the plain bun. 

The cheese curds I got weren't as appetizing as the ones in previous reviewers' posts. Granted, I took them to go and they squished them in the container so I could take them, but the breading was not crispy like the other photos made them look. I was quite disappointed. 

The staff were very friendly and helpful, though. That is always a positive. 

I really want to give them at least an A-OK rating right now, but based solely on my first visit, that is not my impression. I am planning to return to try a specialty sausage and their fries. I will update my review if the next visit changes my mind.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Take and Bake! Papa Murphy's is like the Subway of pizza, with the speed and efficiency of Jimmy John's. You order your pizza, and in a wink of an eye it's made right in front of you. 

Baking instructions are easy, and the pizza tastes really good for something that is baked in a regular oven. Someday when we have a grill I'd like to grill some pizza and see how it tastes!

They seem to always offer coupons in the mail, and they also have family deals, as well as daily deals. Service has also been cheerful and friendly.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>DISGUSTING !! I had lunch there yesterday. Half way through there was a hair in my sub. It looked like a pubic hair. I took up to the manager and he offered to make me a new one. Since he was the one who made it in the first place I respectfully declined. How about you guys where hair nets or beard nets. I will not go back to this place again.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Let's start with it's interesting.. I mean we walk in and their is a live band playing right as you walk in. So loud you can't even hear your own thoughts. It took the servers a little bit to notice we were waiting to be seated. 

After we were seated we ordered our drinks everyone else had a beer. Which as someone else mentioned they do sell locally made beer which is super cool. I myself had an iced tea only to later trade it for a soda, not the best tea. 

For the appetizer, which we shared between three people! The "Loaded Potatoe Buffalo Gold Fries" the portion was very good after we ate them we had second thoughts on ordering wings also. You should be aware that the fries sound like they might be spicy due to the buffalo sauce and jalapeños, but its rather sweet. 

We decided to go ahead and order the wings. Again sharing 20 pieces of the boneless wings. Deciding to try three different kinds just incase we didn't like a flavor and be forced to eat more than we have to. We tried the parmesan garlic, mango, and the buffalo gold. The parmesan garlic was the best one of the three you can really taste the garlic in the chicken.  

The reason why I didn't give Bootys four stars is because of the loud music. You can even hear the person next to you talk. The service was a little slow this might be because they're still new. If these things were to change I believe this could be a regular hang out spot for us.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I am always excited to hear about new authentic Chinese restaurants in Mad Town. This did not disappoint. I ordered the Cantonese egg noodles in a spicy broth with streaky pork and wontons. The obvious comparison is Wah Kee Noodle, also on my favorite list.  The noodles are equally good, though I didn't like the broth quite as much as what I've had at WKN. The pork was tasty, but my dining partner had beef--it was better. The wontons were quite different from WKN, but both are delectable. And awesomely delicious chili sauce is present on every table in delightful little tins (you have to ask for it at WKN, but whatevs). I loved the atmosphere of Hong Kong Station, from the tin bar signs and classic movie memorabilia to the ducks hanging in the deli case.  Two thumbs way up. I'll be back.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Well, I don't write a lot of reviews, but FINALLY! This place has the real deal. 

For further information on the Italian Beef (IB) sandwich from my hometown, go here: 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_beef 

To preface this, I went to High School at St. Ignatius in Chicago. For those unaware, you walked out the back parking lot onto Taylor Street, with the original AL's right there. I grew up on these Muttherf&amp;&amp;^&amp;% sandwiches. In my mind, that makes me an expert. I could eat them 3 times a week back home and never get tired. Sorry if that sounds a bit arrogant, but...well, just trust me. 

That's right. No cheese, no mushrooms, none of the other BS other places try to pass off as a real IB. This little place has managed to capture it better than Luke's (which isn't bad) and the now defunct Al's up north. Sorry to see them go, but that joint was way overpriced, and tried to do too much. 

The IB was shaved paper thin, and the sweet peppers were good. I asked for it dipped and on getting back to the office, it was still a bit too dry for my taste. Next time I will ask for is soaked or double dipped, or whatever they call it there. The juice was dee-licious, reminiscent of Portillos and Al's from back home. I did not get the hot peppers (not my thing), so I cannot comment on that. 

I also had the fries, which were foodservice, but cooked nice and crispy. Note to them: If you read this, you need to throw a bit of salt on them RIGHT AFTER leaving the fryer. 

Excellent service! I got trapped behind a bunch of businessmen that ordered all kind of food, including grilled chicken Sammie's. They had my to go order ready in less than 5 min. Well done. 

All I need now is White Castle, and a REAL deep dish pizza that isn't bought at AJ's in the frozen section, and All the Chicago staples will be here in the valley. 

If YOU LOVE ITALIAN BEEF, CHECK THIS PLACE OUT. 

Beef sandwich: $5.00 Fries: $1.00.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Turkey dinner for 3 review

Pros:  The corn bread, green beans, and creamed spinach were delicious.  

Cons:  The turkey was dry, the gravy was uninspired, and the apple pie is almost unedible.  I will definitely try something else next time.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Quick review: Family-run breakfast/lunch joint with your typical diner staples.  Quaint and cozy, lots of comfort foods.  Nothing spectacular, though the homemade breads are quite good.  A bit on the pricey side and can fill-up with people quickly, especially on the weekends.

Detailed review:
I've lived near C's for about a year now, and have never stopped-in to check it out.  Folks at work gave mixed reviews - some raved about the place, others gave it a "Meh."  I run past it nearly every morning and they always seem to have a good-sized crowd, especially on Saturdays and Sundays, so I figured it had to be somewhat decent... with that, I treated myself to a breakfast this morning.

I wandered in at around 9:30am on Memorial Day and was pleased to find plenty of seating.  The hostess offered me a table outside, which was a nice bonus - the weather was gorgeous, so I happily took the offer.  I also grabbed one of their complimentary/shared newspapers to read.

A waitress stopped by to ask for my drink order - I went with coffee - and to drop off a menu.  She came back a few minutes later with an acrylic coffee cup and a stainless coffee carafe.  She left to tend to another table; I needed some cream for the coffee... oh well, it was nice and I was happy to continue browsing the menu, sans cream for my coffee.

Breakfast offerings were ordinary: eggs, hashbrowns, pancakes, omelets, skillets, and a couple of extras, like eggs benedict, belgian waffles, and some homemade pastries (turnovers, donuts, muffins, cookies, etc).

The waitress stopped by to ask if I was ready to order - told her I decided on the "Hen's Nest" which consisted of 2 eggs, hashbrowns, and toast.  I also ordered a pancake, and requested some cream for the coffee.  She apologized and immediately brought some half-n-half containers.  We were in business.  

Before leaving to take my order to the kitchen, she asked if I'd like anything in the hashbrowns.  I was pleased!  C's has some specialty hashbrown items on the menu, but I didn't want to order a huge plate of them... so, when the offer surfaced to add onions, peppers, tomatoes, etc to my potatoes, I jumped at the chance.

Food came about 20 minutes later and looked tasty.  The pancake was a lot thinner than I had pictured, but it was quite tasty.  I found myself wishing I had ordered 2.  

The Hen's Nest was just "OK" - the hashbrowns weren't greasy and featured a nice, crispy char,  but the onions and peppers didn't do much for flavor, oddly enough... I found the entire dish to be largely flavorless.  :-(  

The multigrain toast was very good - and was probably the star of the entire meal.  The waitress only stopped by once more - to drop off the check, which was a bit of a shocker as well... $12 for my modest breakfast - $5.99 for the Hen's Nest, $0.89 for adding extras to the hashbrowns, $2.99 for one (1) pancake (!!!), $1.89 for coffee.

Service = 2 stars (nothing great)
Food = 3 stars (average breakfast fare)
Value = 1.5 stars (quite pricey for what it was)
MISC = 3 stars (bakery items looked stellar, nice outdoor patio, very relaxing)

I'd really like to give C's 2.5 stars, but I'm feeling a bit generous so, it's a 3-star "gift" rating.  Had I been in a crankier mood, it would've gone 2-stars... :-)

For what it's worth, I think the Hubbard Avenue Diner has a better overall breakfast, and it's about 1/2 the price.  It'll probably be a while before I visit C's again.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Brodards in Las Vegas!! Nem Noung Bistro is a family branch of Brodards from OC! 

Nem Noung Bistro is my new favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas!!! 

Came here on Memorial day weekend and was pleasantly surprised! My family has had a Vietnamese restaurant in the Bay Area for over 35 years so getting a good rating for Excellent Vietnamese food is as rare as winning the big jackpot in Las Vegas.

We order their specialty, Nem Nuong (Must Try!!) and Banh Khot (So Good) , Beef Salad, Bun Thit Noung Cha Gio, and Rice Plate with everything under the sun on it. The food was tasty and had the perfect flavoring. 

My parents, who are Vietnamese food critics in their own right, kept saying how impressed they were and how happy they have found a new place they can frequent now that they will be spending more time in Vegas for Retirement. 

The service was also very warm and friendly from everyone. Two in particular that I really appreciated was a waiter by the name of Dang and Laura, who is the new owner. I usually don't ask for names, especially at Vietnamese restaurants, but Dang always had a big sweet smile and I can feel that he wholeheartedly wanted to do a good job, which was more than I can say about some of the other places in town who ignored us most of the time. Laura also always made sure the food was good and our waters were full. 

They were also very apologetic that the food took a little longer than expected but I didn't feel that it took long at all. I mean it's Memorial Day weekend with a million Vietnamese people in town wanting to all eat at the same time. With 30+ years of working at my family's restaurant, I can empathize how hectic and stressful it must have been with a grand opening in the same weekend that Paris by Night show was going down. I personally believe that Nem Noung Bistro ( Brodards) did it flawlessly and I will definitely will be going here every time I come to Vegas! Nuff Said!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I'm not sure someone who is tone deaf has any business reviewing the Phoenix Symphony, but here is my unqualified take on it minus any technical critique.

It's something everyone should go to at least once, even if you think it's not for you.  And don't buy into the tales of these evildoers that wander around Yelp complaining there is no culture in Phoenix.  The musicians are talented, at least in this tone-deaf Yelper's humble opinion.

We've gone to a few performances.  The Mr. prefers the Classical series which is enjoyable even if sometimes I want to take a nap.  I prefer the Pop series.  And mixed in with this are a variety of holiday performances (the Hocus Pocus Halloween performance was really entertaining!)  On the plate for next Spring...an Elvis tribute.  Yep, I'll be there.  Also Simon &amp; Garfunkel and McCartney/Beatles tributes, and music from the 30's &amp; 40's.  

Now between all that and the Classical stuff, there really is something for everyone.  Also, I'm on their mailing list and recently got a 48% off if you purchased tickets within 48 hours for Hocus Pocus.  I love a good deal!  One final note.  One of the musicians has an assist dog who is darn cute and had a pumpkin cape on last time.  How can you say no to that?</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The Bristled Boar!! Just the name in itself is a sign of class.  With its Barn like exterior, and its huge Boar's head are signs of a true Townie bar the town of Middleton can be proud of.  

As you walk in, the open area for the pool, Foosball, and darts is a nice area separated from the bar allowing proper game play and competition. Also the boar's Juke has a very nice display of music including some of my personal fav's Shinedown, System of a Down, and Hinder. The bar also has an interesting array of  patron's for the true elderly drunks that have been attending this place from their mid 30's to those of the younger ages just looking to throw a few to many back. It allows for many interesting interactions making an evening here very fun!!
 
Agreed with other reviews the beer selection is limited but they do have a descent array of hard liquors especially my personal favorite WHISKEY!! The prices from my one time stop seemed reasonable and the drinks actually had some liquor in them instead of just soda or water.
 
I have yet to try any food or enjoy their volleyball courts but would recommend that anyone interested in a townie atmosphere with the possibility of some excitement to give the place a try. I know I look forward to taking some of my friends to this place to get their opinions of what I like to call Middleton's Best Townie Bar!!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Ordered an array of chaat and a pizza to share. Had a chocolate croissant and samples of cake. Don't be afraid to just order. Only complaint is I need a translation to know what I am ordering but with everything tastes so good it really doesn't matter.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The majority of the food was tasty and obviously prepared by a skilled chef, but I had too many issues with Aizle to feel I want to return. From the list of ingredients many were not presented to us in any dishes. The 4 courses turned out to be 7 or 8 and there were significant gaps between each, which all took only moments to consume. Maybe I just don't enjoy this kind of dining experience, but we were there for 2 and a half hours and it felt like it was dragging. The cocktails were nice but not amazing, The service was over the top - being interrupted constantly to fill wine and water glasses became more than annoying and we felt that we kept having to stop talking for our own privacy. Didn't seem to fit the otherwise quite casual dining room and presentation of the staff.  It is a really nice fit-out inside. But not my kind of place.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This Pizza Hut is just a take-out location, no eat-in; they may do delivery also.  It's best if you call your order ahead and stop by to pick it up rather than dropping by. If you drop in and order, you'll need to wait about 15 minutes for your order. They have their best-selling pizzas and 2-liter sodas. 

They're on the corner in a busy, tight shopping area on N 16th Street.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Despite hearing rave reviews for this place and seeing that they have won loads of awards, I find myself feeling slightly underwhelmed. When it comes down to it, it is a very average Thai restaurant. That's not to say it's terrible, just nothing special. And for the prices they charge, you would think they think they are. 

I will admit, I am obsessed with Pad Thai, and their version was good, not spicy enough for my liking but nice. The thing is, 11 squid for a average bowl of prawn noodles seems a wee bit steep to me. My friends also had a duck and lychee curry and their analysis was the same, nice but a bit boring, and not worth the price. If you are looking for a good restaurant near there go to Thai Orchid instead, it is the best in Edinburgh, and Spicebox offers a delivery alternative which is similar but noticeably cheaper. For me this is the Ruan-g Thai to go to</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Cargo Bar is part of the Festival Inn's chain, which originally put me off as I was used to the Grassmarket/Cowgate Festival Inn bars which can be a little disapointing. However I was pleasantly suprised by Cargo.

 It has a more upmarket, wine bar feel to it as opposed to just being a pub. It is quite spacious and has a fantastic outside patio area, so great in the summer for those long nights. Although to appreciate it you have to put up with the smokers. Cargo Bar accepts the SR card which is a student card that entitles you to cheap drinks and 2 for 1 on some food. £1.75 for a vodka mixer is pretty good for a nice bar! 

The food is pretty good in here too. I had some haggis spring rolls purely because I was intrigued that there was such a thing, and there were really tasty. Who knew that would work? My friend had a cheeseburger which looked cheeseburgery. 

This bar is ideal for a cheap girly night out as they do some cocktails too. I see they are doing a Sex and the City premiere night and I am super tempted to go!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The wait staff were amateurs, I hate having too ask for refills &amp; anything add'l. Our yamakake bowl should come with shoyu but we had to ask for it, we had to ask for small plates to share the dishes, quite frustrating. 

The food was very bland &amp; needed more flavor. The portions did not fit the prices. I'll be willing to give them another chance but I'll wait a while so they get more experience.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I wish I could remember who it was that told me about Olympic Flame... I seem to recall that some out of town friends stopped by for dinner on their way to the airport and said that it was empty but great.  33 years old and losing it already!

Well, I'm glad I remembered that they said it was really good.  Growing up in Detroit, we had awesome Greek food all of the time.  It's hard to find it here in the Valley, but Olympic Flame's got it!  At least they have really delicious Greek salads (that's all I've had so far).

Frank, the owner, has been there both times I've stopped by.  He must get bored as it seems business is slow, but they've been there for years so I guess their catering business does really well - either that or they're making money elsewhere. Hmmm...

Anyways, back to the salad - crispy, crunchy lettuce, cucumber, tomato, peppers, onions (which I normally don't eat but i did with this salad), feta, olives, and grilled chicken.  I am very picky about chicken for some reason but this was thick, juicy, tender chicken and it came with a huge portion sliced on top. The dressing was the perfect balance of oil, vinegar, and whatever other secret spices they use, but it was delicious!

I'm kind of bummed that I waited so long to try this little gem... but then again, it doesn't look like it's going anywhere anytime soon.  I'll be back - maybe even to try their catering services.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>One of my favorite fast food places. Too bad the closest one to me is 40 miles away!

You get the total drive-in experience here. You park your car in front of a menu board where you place your order through the intercom and swipe your card. How convenient! Their servers bring your food to your car on roller skates, and it tastes just how you would expect fast food to be.

I'd definitely recommend Sonic if you want a different, fast food experience.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I've been here several times and overall the food is very good.

Sandwiches and burgers in the $7-8 dollar range are above average. I recommend the triple decker reuben sandwich- lots of good quality corned beef- ask them for the dressing on the side though as they tend to drown it. Burgers are good- recommend the patty melt. Downside is the fries are sub par.

I've also tried a couple of their Chinese dinners and they aren't too good IMO- pass on those.

Service is typical Vegas- hit or miss and usually at a snails pace.

The restaurant can get very crowded during peak meal times.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>As you may or may not have read in my profile, this was the venue where I attended my first concert. It was Tiffany - I was about eight years old, the opening act was a magician (oh, you heard me), and I spent the entire last half of the show crying in the bathroom because it was too loud.

since then, i've seen such awesome shows there as Modest Mouse, Fugazi, The Violent Femmes, and the Warped Tour. It has seating, but I've never attended a show where it was assigned or ticketed seating - more like grab a seat i fyou want or go down to the stage and stand. 

did i mention the stage spins? pretty rad, so you never have a bad angle, and i remember for the modest mouse show being blown away by the fact that they had two drummers with full drum sets and watching them rock out close up for the first time really ever. the bar area and bathroom (where i hid out from the teenage screams of "I Think We're Alone Now" is in this downstairs basement type area. 

all in all i like going there for more well-known bands that aren't huge. it's the perfect size to feel like you're still at a show, and not a mile away watching the action on a screen.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I've never had the opportunity to try real authentic deep dish Chicago pizza (in Chicago of course), however Old Chicago's version was impressive as far as I could tell.  I went in for lunch and it was slow (never a really good sign), I ordered the personal pizza/salad combo.  The salad was a nice size and everything was fresh and crispy.  The pizza came out hot, and the crust was soft, thick and crusty where it was supposed to be!  The wait staff at this time was very thin and our waitress was over extended (she had a large table of 7 to tend to including some other tables) and ended up being waited on by the hostess in addition to who I believed to be the supervisor/manager, so service was a bit choppy.  Definitely do not go to this place for atmosphere or service, but if you want good deep dish, this is as good as I've tasted thus far.  I give this place 3 1/2 stars.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Location of the place is perfect, right at about the top with the Mall below, and East Washington running across - very city like and nice views. 

The service was eh - same as any other you can expect. The inside was gorgeous- the lobby , amazing. The pool, ok. The hallways, nice. The rooms... ehh not too sure - wasn't what I had expected. Paid a very high price when could have stayed at Hilton for same amount.  Wasn't what my fiance and I had expected. Don't let the looks of The Crowne Plaza attract you in.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>If you're a student with no way to get to Lao Lan Xaag, this place will do.  However, the place looks run-down and the service would best be called 'casual'.

Food was good though.  It's just that it can be so much better.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We went through drive-thru. It's right by our house, and we were in a Taco Bell kind of mood. Marcelle was our cashier. He was super polite and courteous. Lots of toppings on our nachos and burritos. Thanks! Now we know this is a great Taco Bell.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Fab gluten free options and great non-standard vegetarian options. Being GF can be a challenge and having to do the whole asking thing and then it being clear that staff don't have a clue what you are talking about then makes the whole thing a bit awkward and full of trepidation in case they got it wrong and you suffer the consequences later.

Not here. Most of the menu is naturally gluten free - no cheap wheat fillers here clearly! Good quality ingredients and lots of choice. I could have crispy stuff (normally off limits), I could have chips without fear of contamination. The Apiary rocks and I'm heading back in a few days with a friend who missed out.

Beware though. The whole menu is so damn tempting - from little bites, the starters, the mains and the desserts. Portions are on the hearty side for mains so I was full to bursting after dinner here. Crispy pigs ears were delish with aioli as were the whitebait starters. I opted for one of the specials - guinea fowl wrapped in pancetta with duck confit and sage and shallot mash - it was lovely but even I was defeated in not being able to clear the plate. Plus I had seen the dessert options and I wanted to test them out.

Dessert was a coconut sponge with lime and Malibu - it was delish. I never did the whole Malibu thing as a teenager but all the flavours worked out so well.

Everyone appeared to love their food and there were lots of head nods and smiles as we chowed down.

So, I still think Newington rocks as an eating area and The Apiary is a great addition. It is cosy without being cramped and there are some lovely touches - little booths with coat hooks on the side, gorgeous prints and décor and just a lovely warm, buzzy feeling. So I'm heading back in a few days and I plan on taking my next lot of visitors here too :-)

Prices - bites around £2.50 (bread is cheaper and GF is available too), starters around £5 with mains around £10-17 and desserts around £6. Wine - starts from £3.50 a glass with carafe options (£8) and a decent price range for bottles.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Big Daddy's pizza, what used to be Damiano's. I didnt try Damiano's pizza to compare it to Big Daddy's. I guess I've been spoiled to the $5 carryout pizza at little caesars. I saw this place and why not give it a try. their $5 pizza is small compared to regular $5 at caesars. 
Flavor: ok, kinda reminded me of the frozen pizzas at the grocery store.
crust:ok

would I be back? highly unlikely. I can travel a lil down the ways to grab a pizza of a larger size and Ok taste.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place is close to my house- closer than either Tacos Mexicos or Robertos, so it's on common rotation at my house. My boyfriend prefers to get a carne asada super burrito while I tend to try either tacos or different burritos. Their lengua &amp; carnitas are good, but I found lots of sharp bones in my birria, which ruined the experience for me. Their super burritos come with lettuce, tomato, sour cream, rice and beans plus the meat of your choice for 4.75, about the average. Their burritos are large and filling, making either a hearty meal or two lighter ones. Their chile relleno burrito is a little more, but  fairly tasty.
Be warned: their nachos are crap. You can get much tastier nachos a mile or so down the street at either the Roberto's at Russel or the one in the Sinclair station by Indios. 
Refills are not free but I always get my food to go so that's not an issue for me. I don't know how stringent they are about it, but they have signs warning against sharing drinks. 
Another decent burrito shop in Vegas. Nothing so outstanding its worth driving across town for, but cheap and filling if you're in the neighbohood.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Beware of the car wash!  Nobody cares and it does a crappy job.  Parts are falling off.  Rollers have fallen off and can slice your tires.  The brushes leave dirt strips on you car.  BEWARE!  It's not worth going there anymore.  Their sun shade has fallen off so they just put street cones around it and leave it that way for weeks (months?)!  It screams absentee owner!  I warned you!  I don't think it's a City Stop anymore.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is one of my favorite spaces in the State Street area.  I used to have regular lunch and dinner dates here with friends, chatting away the winter afternoons to endless cups of hot tea and warm soup.  It's a nice respite from the wind chill in the winter, construction in the summer, and craziness of State during the academic year.  The lighting is dim, the music is soothing, and the tea is hot, spiced with cardamom, and FREE (the refills will keep on coming too).  My favorite waiter is long gone (left in 2006 for better things in Milwaukee) and the service can be a bit slow and inconsistent but the falafel is consistently good -- crispy on the outside, spicy, hot, and moist on the inside.  I often go for the arayis beef sandwich (approx $7, Summer 2008) for a filling lunch that will keep me going at the library through night.  The kefta is also quite nice.  If you go super hungry with a few people, the m'hamara is far above average!  Two brief warnings -- the prices have gone up nearly every two years since 2004 and on one occasion the restaurant was closed unexpectedly for nearly 6 weeks.   Falafel sandwiches (with crispy and above average fries) used to be only $3!!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>4th day open and may I say that high tide has outdone themselves!  Me and my wife drive to scottsdale to get great seafood 2 times a week, not anymore!  We just happend to drive by and see this place last night and stopped in very skeptical... No longer skeptical!!!  We sat at the oyster bar and the bar manager Jon quickly ran down there craft beers, specialty cocktails and great wine selection, I must say I was a little nervous ordering a martini with avocado but jeez it was amazing!  My wife took jons recommendation on a red blend called saved and it rose above our expectations.  Everyone claims fresh food, made to order, quality ingredients but I will tell you as an avid restaurant goer high tide clearly truly knows the meaning of all three.  I don't like a lot of places but I will say that high tide is now my favorite new restaurant.  Unbelievable staff, quality food, and a beautifully modern decor to top it all off!  If you don't try it out you are doing yourself a disservice!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Very good! I'm a pretty picky eater when it comes to food and this place was up to my standards. I got the chicken breast and beef kabob(comes w rice/grilled veg and salad)  a side of hummus and chicken noodle soup. The meat was really good and clean, (I hate when I get those gross weird UFO pieces of whatever)... Defiantly all just perfectly delicious juicy clean meat! The place is really clean to. My dog was in the car so I had to take the order to go but I will definitely come back again when I'm in the area to dine in. :)</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place is awesome.  We went there regularly for years until we moved.  The staff was always friendly.  The martini selection is vast and they will even concoct something special for you if you ask.  The downstairs has a relaxing blue tone and the upstairs is red (only open during busier hours or for private parties).   Martinis are about $9 but you can buy one-get one Thursdays &amp; Fridays from 7-10.  The crowd is older earlier in the night (~35-40) until 8 or 9 and then the college students come in.  Try the stuffed olives appetizer, yum!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We started off with Mango Margaritas, the obligatory salsas and chips and a delicious (complimentary) tortilla soup.  Our entrees were Red Snapper Coscina - sautéed red snapper filet with a zesty tomato and cilantro sauce accompanied by rice and homemade refried beans. A picture of our entrees may be found in Webster's Dictionary under the page heading "Mediocre". We concluded the meal by sharing a caramel flan that was too dense, but very tasty.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I usually never buy food at the airport, but I'm so glad I did today. Something caught my attention about this place when I walked by and I did a quick yelp search. When I saw they have another location in Scottsdale with 4.5 stars, of course I had to give it a try. This isn't your typical Dreyers variety ice cream. They have "artisanal" ice cream with flavors like peanut butter chip, real mint chip (it's not green!), and their most popular flavor is salted butter caramel swirl. I sampled the almond butter crunch and didn't need to sample anything else. This was it. The ice cream has the perfect amount of sweetness. There are whole almonds mixed in, and I just about died and went to heaven when I bit into a whole chunk of toffee. At $2.95 for a single scoop (a pretty small one) I wouldn't say this is completely unreasonable, especially for it being at the airport. I wish I forked over another $1.50 for a double scoop though. One definitely wasn't enough. I came to AZ for a dental school interview, and I think I might choose this school just to come back for this ice cream!

This location is at the airport in terminal 4, next to gate B4.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I stopped by this place a few weeks ago just because it happened to be on my way that day. The owner John and main barista Chris truly care about the coffee and have spared no expense making it the best coffee around. I will continue to tell everyone i know to get their coffee at this new spot in Tempe.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I finally got the chance to attend a Bingo UYE with Khatherine T. and a full table of Yelpers.  What fun!  Since several of us were going to see the Spazmatics in the showroom after bingo, we were encouraged to dress 80s style.

It was interesting to see how some people came to bingo.  Not just our group, but others who were also going to see the Spazmatics.

After getting our tables under the large chandelier, Sylvia Q. went and got reserved signs to hold our seats.  Then a short wait in line to get our bingo games, pick up our electronic bingo machines, and we were ready to go.  The technology has improved so much you really have nothing to do but watch your screen and swear--well perhaps!

With the electronic machines, we were able to chat, laugh, and make fun of our friends.

What a great way to spend an hour with some very fun and nice people!  I hope I can make the next one!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>What, a gay sports bar?  Isn't that an oxymoron?  Well, I think that the owners would rather refer to their place as a sports bar that just happens to be gay.  (Not that there's anything wrong with that.)  Aside from the small rainbow flag inside it's not THAT obvious (well except for all the gay guys inside).

But seriously, this is a legit sports bar with about 10 plasma TVs throughout with a variety of sports - with usually the Suns, D-backs, Cards or ASU/UA on the tube.  The walls show pennants and sports signage galore.  The crowd skews just a tad older than BS (upper 20s and 30s, rather than lower 20s), and attracts the gay sports fans.  Service is always good and quick.  

There are a handful of pool tables (my home for a quick game of pool), a few dart boards and one of those new-fangled jukeboxes in the joint.  

But best of all Roscoe's has 2-4-1 drinks on Tuesday (and is easily its busiest night), $1 beers on Saturdays and has the electronic console with the hot and heavy Photohunt!!

I've never had it, but they also serve bar food (nachos, hot wings, etc.).  Cash only on Tuesdays.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Great little spot for a fast weekend breakfast or workday lunch. Very friendly, accommodating and eager to please. And the place is spotless.

The menu situation can be confusing. They seem to have more dishes on offer that you would think -- be sure to ask about specials. I'd recommend a specials board that they can change daily in addition to the chalkboard menu behind the counter. 

One little ambience minus: Radio tuned to a Top-40 station is a little intrusive especially when there are commercials. Proprietors should consider hooking up an iPod instead and lowering the volume a little.</review:review_text>

They have a GREAT Bloody Mary bar (lots of options) and cheap food. Perfect for a hangover. :)</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is where it's at! If you are looking for really good, cheap and somewhat late night (I think they are open till 11pm) mexican food, you've got to try Rosita's. I absolutely loooove their mole sauce-- best in the Valley. Try the beans and rice burro, enchilada style with mole.  Pair it with a nice cold Pacifico-- Sunday afternoon Heaven! Their salsas are to die for, and both the red and green pack some serious punch!  You've got to pay a dollar for chips, but it's so worth it. The tamales are also muy delisioso!

The little old ladies who work here are absolutely adorable in their little matching dresses. They are no nonsense, too. There's a sign posted that says "Please control your children!" I love it. Plus, they have a kick-ass temporary tattoo machine at the front where you can buy "Dogz" tattoos, with realistic looking dogs in gangsta settings. Classic.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is the first Marriott I have ever been a little disappointed in.  I thought initially it was going to be an amazing hotel, since I totally screwed up on the reservation (made it for the wrong day) and the girl at the desk was so cool to work with me and get me a room when the whole place was fully booked.  

Except, the place was fully booked for the "Little Miss Junior Miss" Pageant, or some other stupid name like that, which meant HELL for Andy and I as the entire place was infested with pre-teen beauty queens, their scary domineering mothers, and other random siblings that came along for the ride.  Can you say O. M. G.  

Now, normally this would be a non-issue, as we are rarely in our hotel room except to sleep and once in the room you couldnt hear a lot of hallway noise.  But this 10 story hotel had a grand total of 2 elevators, which were packed at all hours of the day with girls in gowns and tiaras, groups of girls in heavy makeup, or wet children dripping from the hotel pool. This made getting in and out a bit challenging since we were on the top floor. 

I realize this is hardly Marriotts fault that the Junior Misses had descended upon Middleton, since they are just trying to turn a buck in this economy, but the design of this place was not user friendly in the slightest.  Also, hey brilliant idea guys, put the pool across the hall from the elevator and then make that whole area tile so people track water out and the floor is slippery!  Nice.  And also understaff the dining area so noone can get in and eat because there is noone to clean off the tables and take your order.  Nice planning!

Man, that whole experience left a bad taste.  The worst part will be trying to convince Andy to stay at a Marriott ever again as he is just now getting relief from the migrane he got on Saturday.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>There was nothing crazy awesome about this place. The vienna dog was over steamed as it had lost its color. The french fries were ok but the ketchup was room temperature at 1130! Yuck! I did like the decorations of the Chicago shirts on the walls and the Pepsi pop was top notch! The man next to me was raving about how good his polish sausage was so maybe go that way! The woman who rung up our order sucked and no one else was as friendly as most Chicago people are, kinda bummed about that!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>If you want to feel like you're staying in an office park, even though it's only blocks from the castle...then this is your place.  The outside and rooms are lackluster (you might even pass by it without noticing, and your room is a basic, rectangular room) but the second floor bar and lounge is pretty classy.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is a very large location with plenty of tv screens to show the latest sporting event which was nice.  The family and I have been here twice so far and had fair experiences both times.  Service has been good; however, the food is not as good as I would expect a typical bar and grill would be.  I ordered the French Dip my first time and a Bistro Burger the second time.  The fries that come with the meal was nothing special and both sandwiches were on the bland side, again, nothing special.  I had a craft brew on my first occasion and that was enjoyable.  I think this would be a good place for friends to meet up to watch a sporting event and maybe order a couple of appetizers.  The food doesn't make me want to return with the family.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>If I was told I could only eat at one State Street restaurant for the rest of my  life, Med Cafe &amp; Himal Chuli would have to battle it to the death... I have no idea how I would ever decide.  The food at Mediterranean Cafe is reasonably priced and always very fresh.  The staff is quite pleasant.  The only downside to Med Cafe, is that it may be best to take your food to go during the lunch rush, as it is quite difficult to score a table and it is usually extremely crowded.  Also you should be aware that in the summer months, they have tended to close earlier. (before 8pm) 
I have been madly in love with the falaffel plate for years. The hummus is awesome. Also try the ever slightly changing usually vegetarian soup with a side of pita bread-- it will cost you around $3 or less.  Don't worry meat eaters; they do usually have some chicken and beef items on the menu.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>No, thanks.

I can't help but think of Office Space's "Chotchke's and their pieces of flair every time I get sucked into going to Applebee's. The poor wait staff. 

And the food is just not good. It could be just an unfortunate coibncidence that of the seven or eight things I have tried they have all failed to impress me but somehow I doubt it. 

I don't like TGI Friday's very much, but of the two comparable restaurants, I much prefer it to Applebee's.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Got a sneak taste of the curry chicken. I usually like a hotter curry, but was pleasantly surprised at how wonderful it tasted! Flower Child uses only the freshest ingredients that don't have GMO!!! Clean food! I have celiac and am always looking for restarsaunts that cater to gluten free choices.

    <review:review_text>I just went there for drinks with friends this past week (either Weds or Thurs, I can't remember which right now).  They had an excellent drink special--$2.50 Absolut mixers.  Woohoo!  

It's an odd place.  It's got an "up north lodge"-kind of vibe in one part of the bar; wood paneling  complete with a boar's head with glowing red eyes.  The other part, I *believe* had a different theme without wood paneling and a linoleum floor with a pool table.  There was a volleyball court outside.  The crowd was a strange mix of middle aged drunks and skanky-dressed younger girls.  

Overall, I have nothing against the bar, and would go back if I was at my friend's house again.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The donuts here are fantastic.  Some of the best I've ever had.  On my first trip I got something that looked like a giant bear claw, but was filled with some cinnamon gooey stuff and apples.  It was divine.  We've also sampled the glaze, chocolate covered, cake, sugar.  All great.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Popcorn is really hit and miss.  They give you a sample of something fresh - but sell you stale popcorn.  I thought it was a fluke - but it's happened a few times now. If you're going to spend that much on something as cheap as popcorn, it had better  be fresh.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is a great spot to go for a good, old-fashioned Italian meal.  The decor is riduculously kitchy and stereotypically "Italian", but a lot of fun.  If you go with kids, I highly recommend asking to sit at the "kitchen table", a booth that's actually located right inside the kitchen!  You get free entertainment as you watch the chefs and waiters scurry about.  (It's usually tough to get this table for dinner, but fairly easy during the lunch hours.)

The food is very good, and the "small" portions are easily enough to split between two people.  We ordered a "sampler" meal, which included ravioli, cannelloni, stuffed shells, and manicotti.  Delicious!  Our little guy ordered the spaghetti and meatballs off of the kids' menu, and barely finished half of his meal.  Prices are reasonable, given the portion sizes, and I have found several coupons for $10 off of a minimum $20 purchase, which is a great deal!

Tip: Come for your birthday and receive a free dessert (if you have room)!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I hadn't been to a T.G.I. Fridays in years before I heard about this place on a recent trip to Phoenix.  It's located inside Chase Field, where the Arizona Diamondbacks play, but it has its own separate entry so you don't need a ticket to the game to get in here during a game. You can, however, see into the park from much of the restaurant. This was cool.

The place looks like any other Fridays, but a little nicer. It has a lot of baseball decor on the walls instead of the typical Fridays bric-a-brac and large TVs to watch games on. Plus, it has large windows that let you see into the park. You can't see the field from many of the seats, but looking in at the crown is fun. 

I was looking forward to stopping at a T.G.I. Fridays to try some of the food featured on that Food Network show, but during games they have a limited menu that excludes a lot of the good stuff including most if not all of the Food network recipes. That was kind of a bummer. 

On the plus side, the food we got was good. It was hot. The service was good and friendly. The beer was cold. We could see into Chase Field.

The server tells me that you can make reservations for the tables outside in the park and inside by the windows for a reasonable price, and half of that price is credited in food. It doesn't seem like a bad deal, and would be worth checking out for a game or an off night, especially for an avid baseball fan.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>this place comprises the sum total of my experience with nepalese food, but by any standard it is delicious.  i am a carnivore and they do have meat, but i never stray from madison's best vegetarian dishes.  the takari changes daily and all are good.  also rock himal's combo platter. flatbread is the platonic ideal.  salad dressing is also addictive.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Chico's Tacos is hidden away in a strip mall right off the corner of 7th Street and McDowell. You can get a burrito, get your taxes done, cash a check, grab a bagel and an espresso before grocery shopping. Neat! 

Chico's food has always been hit or miss with me. The fresh salsa bar is the stand-out feature, with salsas in varying degrees of intensity (I tend to go for the pico de gallo as, I am sure my friends will attest to, I am a wuss). Menu items include the standard tacos, burritos, chimichangas, quesadillas and nachos. There is also your choice of soda, beer, iced tea and margaritas.

I think I had just missed the lunch rush as it was still fairly busy when I went in. The food was prepared quickly, which was good as I was on my way to work and in a time crunch. The chicken chimichanga I ordered was fairly tasty, but a bit on the bland side. The only thing wrapped up in the tortilla (which was swimming in grease inside my to-go container) was cheese and grilled chicken. The side of sour cream helped and the addition of pico de gallo made it much better.

Chico's works well as a lunch spot during the work week because of its central location. However, the parking situation leaves a lot to be desired as it's right next to one of the busier intersections in Phoenix.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Don't be fooled by its weird name and cheap-looking appearance. VIP is a solid, authentic, and good Chinese/Japanese restaurant, probably the best in far West Madison as of May 2014. 

Madison has experienced a real boom in authentic Chinese restaurants in the last 5 years. When I come here in 2009, I can barely name 3 restaurants than I consider a "real thing." Now the list is around 15. There was a time people had to travel to Milwaukee for authentic Chinese food, but now the traffic goes the other way around. 

VIP (it says "VIP Asian Cuisine" on the store front) is the newest addition in this Chinese restaurant boom. 

And, VIP distinguishes itself from other Chinese places by its very trendy and classy dining environment. It is not decorated by cheesy faux-Chinese art pieces. It is much akin to the setting that you can find in modern day bourgeois urban China, and I cannot recall being to similar place in the Midwest. 

VIP's has long and comprehensive menus--one for Chinese and one for Japanese. The Chinese menu contains many Szechuan/Sichuan dishes like Fugu and Ichiban, but it also has items not to found in other places. The prices are comparable to Fugu and Ichiban, too. It definitely takes time for the first-time visitor to navigate the menu, but everything seems to be are pretty "safe" choice.  

If you cannot decide, than stick to the noodle section like I did. VIP handmade their noodles, yes, handmade, so that makes all the difference if you know what I am talking about. 

For less adventurous eaters, VIP also serves American Chinese, and there is an entire thick sushi menu to explore. 

This restaurant is huge. It has many private and semi-private rooms for special occasions. All the servers we encountered today were very helpful and friendly. Based on my first visit, VIP is a solid and authentic Chinese restaurant. Let's see how their business will go, It has a chance to become the top Chinese restaurant in Madison.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Jerry's is what it is- decent, classic diner food. Super cheap, too! I would choose to eat here over Denny's any day. 

Last night, Hubby and I had dinner here. The navy bean soup that was part of my entree was delicious, and so large a bowl we shared it. I had the pot roast, which was yummy and quite tender, but not at all fatty. It came with mediocre boxed mashed potatoes, decent corn, and really good Texas Toast. Hubby had a corned beef sandwich with grilled onions and green peppers which he liked well enough, and it came with macaroni salad that he loved. It was simple, but had lots of super crispy and fresh pieces of onion and celery.

I have also had breakfast at Jerry's twice and both times it was delicious, with eggs cooked just as I ordered them. One caveat- the iced tea is super strong and had us up 'til the wee hours.

Give Jerry's a try if you find yourself on Thomas across the street from the Stuffington Bear Factory.

Three and a half stars.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place has saved me from dry nights on numerous occasions. The sign faintly resembles one of a Harley Davidson merch shop, but upon entry, your greeted with plenty of boozin' options. The vodka assortment is also pretty top notch. I've managed to score some unique domestics and imports. I've often been confused by the age of some of their patrons, but then I remember that this is also a bait shop, and that there is a rare few of today's use that actually go fishing. Ew... worms.

Anyway, the location of this place is another reason I'll continue to visit. For those who haven't been to Madison, 9 PM is when alcohol sales come to a screeching holt. If you're hanging out on the east side, the clock strikes 8:45, and you've realized that you started to sweat because you don't know if you can make it down Willy St. in time on a Friday night, don't worry. Just head a bit more east. 

Harley's may be a little out of the way of the party sector, but you're guaranteed a traffic-free, open road, complete with the freedom to change lanes. You'll have no problems getting here fast enough that you won't turn into a pumpkin.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I was visiting another business in the mall and saw this restaurant and gave it a try for lunch. I'm glad I did as the food was great. Burritos, tacos, salads, quesadillas and enchiladas were the menu items. The fun part is you go down the line (like Subway) and add your ingredients. Each ingredient looked and tasted fresh. Prices are reasonable.  If they served beer, it would be a 5 star.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>It looks like Stations Casinos brought back the Grand Cafe. I didn't have high expectations upon entering this place, since I remember the old Grand Cafe being pretty terrible.

First thing that I noticed was that they're really trying to emphasize better service. Staff is much more friendly and accommodating this time around, which is already an improvement. I never really expected to be greeted with smiling faces and a friendly welcome when I'm in the Boulder Station. I mean, c'mon, it's the Boulder Station. The Boulder Strip doesn't exactly scream with class. 

The menu did go through some minor tweaks, but it still contains the standard cafe fare, with $7.99 daily specials that come with soup or salad. They also  have some off-menu specials like a $3.99 skillet breakfast, $5.99 burger special, or $7.99 for a mountain of Rocky Road pancakes.  

For starters, we ordered some spinach &amp; artichoke dip, served with pita bread. Wasn't too bad, seemed a little lighter than most spinach dips that I have had.

For the entrée, I ordered the potato crusted trout special, one of the Friday specials. It practically looked like a two rectangular hash browns with trout hiding inside. It wasn't too bad actually, especially for a $8 seafood dish.

They tout that their Kona coffee is freshly brewed and ground every 90-minutes, which got me interested in trying it out. I'm no coffee connoisseur, but it tasted good enough for me.

All in all, a decent experience. This is somewhere I'd go for lazy and cheap eating, when I'm not willing to make a drive anywhere to break the bank. It's decent food, but nothing to go out of the way for. It's a definite improvement over the old Grand Cafe, that's for sure.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Wendy's new BREAKFAST blows!

I've never been a huge fan of Wendy's food, however seeing their big window sign of their new breakfast sandwiches drew me in.  My God they looked good!  And my God was I disappointed.  

I had a sausage biscuit with a kick ass looking buttermilk bun that was infused with syrup.  The meat was spicy (ala McDonnalds) but the rest was just yucky.  I highly recommend you skip Wendy's for breakfast.  Bummer.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Da Chicago Dogs &amp; Subs, dey make a freakin' mean Chicago style dog ya know?  I had one der fer lunch and it's still tasting good at 5 o'clock.

Nice selection of toppings and a pretty good variety of subs.  I dropped in here in leu of visiting a chain nearby.

    <review:review_text>OK I might be picky. But when a party of four goes to a steakhouse I expect to see steaks on the tables. But these steak prices are nuts for a casual dinner spot, as were the The four plates on the table all together consisted of less than 18 oz of beef. Pretty sad for a steakhouse if you ask me. 

But I will say this for the place. The staff and management was nice except for the one waiter lacking manners and reaching over me and across my plate to hand off condiments to my dining partner. 

The staff is quick to refill your glasses. Friendly and otherwise thoughtful. 
I might not come there for a meal again but I would consider it a decent place for appetizers and drinks. So the Saloon might just become a favorite watering hole for me from time to time.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Its starbucks! Its friendly, has a consistent taste anywhere you go and free wifi! And a starbucks in a shopping mall is one of the best things! After a few hours of shopping, and trying on too many things that don't fit or make you look fat, its just perfect to get a nice latte and relax! There is plenty of seating and there is even a roped off section in the mall (outside the store) for starbucks only seating! 
I love my starbucks so really I'm always happy to see one around!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>At £13.50 for 3 courses the January sale here was definitely good value for money and at 13:30 on a Friday the place was virtually full so had clearly caught a number of eyes. I'd been interested in paying it a visit for a while so my birthday offered a good opportunity.


 Service-wise I got the impression that an extra member of staff would have made quite a difference - my starter arrived near instantaneously after it was ordered (tasty oxtail terrine so I suppose it was just a question of slicing it and delivering it to the table) yet the main courses took far longer than you'd normally expect. Our waitress was though very able. They were good when they got there though - my no nonsense duck and beans went down a treat. My parents both enjoyed the apple tarts they had for dessert, but felt that the main course fish could have down with more veg or the option of a side-order of such. Within the terms of the deal the cheese board was fine and certainly had enough biscuits but £5 for brie and something un-named, even with the blob of quince jelly would I think have seemed too much to pay on its own.


 We had a pleasant Merlot to wash it all down but having no wine cheaper than £15.50 is I think something else that this establishment needs to look at, particularly in these financially straitened times.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The great thing about the Global Deli is that from a mile off, it is hard to miss. In fact, this simple thing is the reason I first entered Global, and Im glad that I did.

The deli is simply amazing - a huge range of things to choose from, and always full of returning customers who know how great this place really is.Panninis, rolls, sandwiches - they do it all, either choose from the menu or ask nicely and create your own. The food is always prepared infront of you, including the morning rolls that they do (sausages and bacon etc), so a feeling of freshness is always there.

The global Deli is a great place to grab a tasty, and fresh something to eat.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Bautista's Filipino Kitchen goes by the acronym BFK, yes the very same BFK from Hawaii. Cool to see Filipino cuisine now in the Galleria food court! They have a good variety of Filipino favorites like Pinkabet, Diniguan, Pork Gisantes, Chicken &amp; Pork BBQ sticks and Adobo. There's also some desserts like Halo Halo w/Ube ice cream listed.  Prices are pretty reasonable. You can choose ala carte or get 2,3 or 4 item combo plates. It's presented in heating warming trays. It's kind of turo turo style I guess since you do have to point to what you want. 
  
First visit:  I tried pancit and longanisa.  I like the mixture of pancit and vegetables, seasoned well. I can taste garlic. I love garlic. Longanisa was sweet and fatty but not too greasy when you cut into it. That's a good thing.  But while I did like both food items, temperature wise it was not hot, lukewarm at best. Even the white rice that came with the combo plate I got was just warm. I ended up throwing my meal after a few bites.

 
BFK was just into their 3rd day of their soft opening I learned afterwards and the employee I talked to said they'll start serving their cooked to order breakfast on the 9th. Cooked to order, now that I can go for!

Second visit: Wanted the Adobo Rice Omelette since the breakfast menu was up and it says served 'ALL DAY - MADE ON DEMAND'...well just not right now the employee said. Since it was going on the last hour (it was a little after 5pm mall closes at 6) the kitchen was shut down for the day, plus she was by herself. Well so much for MADE on DEMAND! ugh... She did suggest the adobo and rice already available, but I wanted a cooked to order item. Oh well.
 
Settled for the noodle plate of Pancit and 2 Lumpia.  At least this time I can see steam coming up from the warming trays so I took it as a good sign my food will be hot this time.  It was warmer than before. Tasted alright. The noodles were slightly mushy and the lumpia wrapper wasnt crisp. I attribute it to being left on those warming trays too long. Ended up throwing my meal again after a few bites.

Don't get me wrong, the food tastes good, but I prefer cooked to order meals. It's a personal pet peeve of mine. I tried to like it. So take that into consideration reading this review.

Anyways staff was cheerful and friendly. The place appears clean. I do look forward to trying out that Adobo Rice Omelette and Halo Halo one of these days. Maybe the third time visit will be a charm.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Ok, I know it's a bit weird to be reviewing a street, but I  love Thistle Street. What's not to love??! It has the most amazing restaurants and the best atmosphere in the whole city. This is the sort of place that yelp is made for, you wouldn't necessarily notice the narrow, unassuming street unless you were loooking for it.

Cafe Marlyane is a lovely French restaurant, and Fishers in the City is one of the best fish restaurants i've ever been to.

The narrow cobbled streets make it one of my favourite places to eat in the whole of Edinburgh</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>It was great to find a New York / Jewish style Deli in the middle of Phoenix on my last trip out there.  Miracle Mile doesn't hold back on their servings and prices albeit a tad high, is well worth it.  You can't go wrong with the 3-D Sandwich Combo, it has Corned Beef, Pastrami, and Roast Beef.  Ask them to toss in some thousand island and sauerkraut.  I beleive they have multiple locations, so google or yelp them!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Amazing place -- went there for lunch when it dawned on my that for $9 I could get an amazing mushroom burger with salad instead of playing $7.50  for an ordinary bagel sandwich across the street. Salmon salad is great as is the risotto. 

Very sweet and friendly waitress. Great ambiance. I'll be back</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The Wee Windaes is great if you're looking for an alternative to the uber cool food establishments in Edinburgh.

By that I don't mean that it is the dork of Edinburgh's restaurants or anything - far from it. It's got a great, solid menu that will rival many of Edinburgh's finest dining places, and is a firm favourite with the locals. 

It's got a really impressive seafood menu which includes the classic cullen skink but I am a sucker for Bangers and Mash, so I opted for that last time I was here. It was absolutely delicious and done to perfection. It's simple but one of their strongest and most popular options.

The decor is staid and arguably a little dated but I quite like its charm. The way it looks reminds me of hotel dining rooms I used to visit in British seaside resorts when I was a kid. It looks like it's not changed in years but there's something comforting about that.

My only complaint would be a small one - its opening hours. They serve food from 6-10 but sometimes I'm really craving a bangers and mash if I'm through for a gig and have done a shift of mad dancing. But that's a selfish demand and it's nice to pop in for a quiet, calming meal at dinnertime.

Good old fashioned grub with a couple of fancy options. I like it.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Lovely big plush, comfortable bar, with a gorgeous gantry. It's right next door to the Playhouse, so it's a good place to visit either before or after taking in a show.


 The Theatre Royal does get very busy sometimes, so if you want to get a seat, make sure you arrive early.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I was pleasantly surprised, and I'm very hopeful for this place!

After seeing a handful of restaurants come and go in this location, I truly hope this one sticks around!  

My friends and I stopped by for happy hour, even though this place is still under it's "soft opening".

We had beer and wine, and then ordered some bruschetta, a meat and cheese plate, hummus and an ahi tuna panini.
All of the food was very tasty, and the drinks were equally delicious.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I'm torn between how yummy the food is or how poor the service was. I came with a family of four and ordered the pot stickers appetizer coming with I believe 6 pieces? I also got the ck pad thai, the Kung pao ck, and yellow ck curry. But I waited a little longer than an hour and an half for my last dish!!!! Plus they brought our dishes two at a time so we all were eating at different times.. Such Ridiculous service.. We called out to the waitresses and waiters about 3-4 times yet none of them "heard" us.. Another table also didn't receive water until 30 min after being seated! There is a lot of patience I have as a person but over an hour an a half for some "wonderful" food. I cannot.. So! If you like Thai and don't mind waiting foreverrrrr then here is the place to go (: &amp; if not? Make sure to have bunches and bunches of patience. (Btw. As a girl the only thing that frustrated me less? Was the hand scrubs in the BR. Lol.)</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Great food, fair prices.

I had the chicken breast sandwich which was good, my wife had the italian sausage which was great. The owner took our order, was friendly and helpful. It took a little while to get our food but it was rather apparent that was because it was cooked to order.

Great for lunch, definitely give it a try if you're in the area.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Mathers is a small bar with an excellent hole-in-the-wall, 'local' feel, including friendly, knowledgeable staff who make everyone feel welcome.  The only concern I had was that no one seemed to be eating there; this concerned my friends enough -- based on the amount of time we were there and the number of locals who came through -- that we went elsewhere for the meal without checking on a menu.  That's somewhat of an unfair comment since we didn't ask, but I wanted to mention it because it seemed strange to us that evening.  I would definitely return at least for drinks again though!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Sushi J is a great local sushi spot in old town Scottsdale. Definitely not your 'see &amp; be seen' overrated &amp; overpriced Ra or terrible service of Stingray. Locally owned, Chef J is knowledgeable &amp; takes great care in creating an experience you want to come back for. The salmon skin roll is one of the best I've ever had &amp; the yellowtail sushi was fresh &amp; well portioned. The Lord of Tuna roll with thin slices of lemon, plus "fresh" wasabi was incredible!

The portions are generous &amp; the pricing fair. They have great "Happy Day" specials...all day specials vs just a happy 'hour.'

Maggie was awesome &amp; so personable on the phone we had to come in for he 4th of July to celebrate with them! Tina was wonderful as well &amp; as a team their service was delightful.

If you're looking for your neighborhood sushi spot in old town Scottsdale that's perfect connecting &amp; enjoying sushi with people who want you coming back, this is the place to be!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Las Vegas, NV (KTNV) -- Dirty Dining is back in Chinatown once again. This time at a restaurant just one demerit shy of shutdown.

It's only been open three months and was almost forced to close its doors.

The name sounds like a massage parlor, but it's actually a restaurant. Hot Feel on Spring Mountain welcomes customers with the wiggly legs of a giant craw fish, and a 40-demerit "C" grade, which worries the owner.

"Yup, your reputation is definitely at stake if you have a C grade posted," Darcy Spears said, talking on the phone to the owner, who had a unique reason for not appearing on camera.

"Your lips are swollen like a sausage? Why? Stress?" asked Darcy. "Your lips are swollen like sausages because of stress from the health inspection."

During that health inspection, an employee handled dirty dishes then prepared food and drinks with no hand washing.

Food was being stored in a freezer that was unplugged. Prepared food on skewers was sitting directly on top of a cardboard box. They had raw chicken and raw beef thawing together in standing water.

The owner said his employees weren't up to speed on health district regulations and the inspection was a wake-up call.

Inspectors found frozen crab legs thawing at room temperature, uncovered food, a dirty ice machine and Diet Coke syrup that had expired back in April.

Hand sinks were blocked and being used for storage. Dirty, greasy water was being used to wash dishes.

There were children and other unauthorized people in the kitchen. Employee drinks and a baby bottle were on prep surfaces next to food.

Hood filters were excessively dirty and greasy and so was the floor behind appliances.

As for their "C" grade, someone had covered it up behind things on the bar. The owner said all will be well by the time they're re-inspected and he has this message: Customers' health is the most important thing and he'll make sure that stays safe.

We have one imminent health hazard closure to talk about. The Smith's supermarket bakery on Rampart and Lake Mead was ordered to shut down because its only hand sink wasn't working.

Another one nearby wasn't draining and was filled with murky, dirty water.

The owner of Hot Feel said he's scheduled their re-inspection for Friday, June 20.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Gandhi's is a great little Indian restaurant just off Lothian Road. I was reluctant to try it at first because I always associated Gandhi as a figure of fasting. I felt it was a bit of an oxymoron to chomp away at an elaborate feast in this place. However, one day I was drawn in by the crowds inside and I haven't looked back. 

Curries in Gandhi's are fresh and delicious. I particularly enjoyed the Bhuna and Biryani. On my last visit ten of us shared a long table and decided to choose almost one of everything. We were very impressed at the high standard throughout and found ourselves ordering more and more okra even though we were stuffed full. 

The staff here are lovely. One trip with a few friends ended up very drunken and we accidently over paid. The waiter was so honest and kind that he ran up to us as we left telling us that he couldn't accept such a huge tip and to take our money back. Service like that makes a restaurant well worth a return visit!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I don't want to waste too much time on this place, but since I mentioned it in another review I feel obligated to say a few words.

This is the worst Burger King in the world so far, and I have been to some bad ones. Everything manages to have a bitter taste that I just cannot explain. I seem to remember a time when BK did not nuke every single thing, but those days are a fading memory. Bitter taste plus microwaved texture equals food that hogs would turn up a nose at. Still the place is usually crowded. 

The one redeeming quality is the staff. I've worked a block away for two and a half years and a lot of the crew have worked there that whole time. They're pretty friendly considering what they get paid. Still, the food is just so terrible I cannot bring myself to give it even two stars.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Staying in Boulder Station, Starbucks is the perfect place to grab a coffee or a light snack!

Been there twice now, first time I grabbed a caramel Lattae and pumpkin bread (which is to die for) and just today I got a Strawberry smoothie and a oatmeal biscuit (cookie).

I wasn't sure with the drink, after describing how I felt they offered the strawberry smoothie which was perfect, and while there I picked up one of their amazing coffee mugs for my mother as a gift.

While the cashier seemed new (unsure on prices and location of certain items) he did his best to help, and he succeeded in that, and the older lady who works there is so sweet

Even though it's amongst bars, cigarets and slot machines, it just provides that little escape from it it all!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Tried a new broasted chicken spot in Vegas. Besides the usual fried chicken spots across the nation, Z Chicken is broasted, which is essentially fried chicken under pressure. In my opinion, this yields a better fried chicken than your standard deep fryer. 

I ordered the 8 piece combo that included 4 biscuits and two side orders. The sides I got were mac and cheese and potato wedges. These side orders and the biscuits were similar to what you find at other fried chicken places, nothing to rave about. However, the chicken was the best I've had out here! Crunchy outside with tender, moist and flavorful chicken beneath the crunchy battered skin. 

The gentleman that took my order was polite and friendly. What I liked most was that my order did not come from a heat lamp and made long before I got there. Every order is made to order, not oil drenched chicken like the national chains. Although this was my first time there, it will not be the last.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The Grand opening of High Tide bar and grill is a welcome addition to Gilbert.  A limited selection of craft beers, some fantastic original mixed drinks, and the steamed pot seafood is prepared to satisfy the most critical pallets. My basic criticism of most seafood restaurants is that they over cook everything, Making the most succulent of foods into rubber. Not so at High Tide.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Hookah lounges are all over Las Vegas but this one is the best in my opinion. 

To the point:
1. The service is fantastic.
2. There is plenty of parking.
3. It is super easy to find.
4. The quality of tobacco/hookah products is excellent. 
5. Knowledgeable staff.

I noticed the flavors and aromas were more robust than I have experienced in the past at the other places. I commented on this and found out that my observation was not insignificant.  This place  owned by a local smoke shop owner who obviously has access to many flavors and the highest quality product.  They always have fresh product. This is an excellent hookah lounge that is a must try if you are in Silverado Ranch.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>"Viad Tower Restaurants" 

First off, I'm not sure that this is the correct name for the restaurant.  I will tell you that this is the restaurant on the second floor of the Viad tower in Midtown Phoenix.  

What a great find.  This is a nice upscale cafeteria style restaurant.  Everything is Homemade from carved sandwiches to pizza and daily specials.  It was Chicken Enchiladas yesterday.  I had a tossed Cobb Salad that they made and tossed in front of me.  It was great and huge.  I could not finish it.

The prices are very reasonable.  I will be back next time I'm in the neighborhood!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Great wings, good pizza, and cheap beer. I don't think you could really go wrong if you came here. 

Also the waitress we had was really nice, we had a ton of leftovers and where about to leave them behind because we where going straight from the restaurant to a bar and didn't want to cart the food around so she offered to put them in a box and leave them for us back behind the counter and even if the place was closed by the tie we came back, she said we could still come in and get our food.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>when we got there we ask for a couple minutes to decide on food and beverages...after the server had not come back for 25 mins we left. Your food is not that great so customer service should be where you shine..just a tip. I will never return to this location.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Viva Elvis , viva Zapata, viva Arepas, viva Mercado, viva Michoacan ...so many vivas are popping up in viva Las Vegas and so many pupuserias but I'm not complaining, we need more options beside those fast food restaurants that only make you miserably fat, we need instead more places that make us happily voluminous. 
 Enter...Viva El Salvador pupuseria restaurant. Here you can find many Salvadorian dishes but like all Salvadorian restaurants pupusas are the main star of the show, thick corn tortillas filled with your choice of ingredients like chicharron (pork) frijoles,(beans) queso (cheese) or revueltas (mixed) covered with curtido (pickled cabbage slaw) and tomato sauce. The good thing about ordering pupusas is that you can order only the amount you want, for me usually two are enough but it all depends on how fluffy you are, also don't forget to order some to go or you'll be wishing you did.
Service is good, order at the counter, find a table and they'll bring the food to you.
Place is clean and very affordable. I can't tell you that this are the best pupusas in town but I can tell you that they are very good and I'll be stacking on pupusas every time I'm in the area.......I give this place 4 stars, although everything here is made from scratch, it could be a little bit faster!

  Viva Yelp for showing me the way to this pupuseria!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>So, everyone that has ever taken a flight has seen that one other really attractive person waiting in line and hoped that they would end up sitting next to them by some random twist of fate.

I was the lucky man once. Her name was Ashley. She was a traveling salesperson working in the education field. She was a cute petite little blond with eyes that could light up the night.

On our second date, I took her to the king club. I never saw her again. I blame the bar. Clearly this situation is not my fault.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Pretty darn expensive for custard but it is really good, possibly the best I have ever had.  Been there over 15 times and have yet to see an adult working in the place.  Service is hit and miss.  Our last trip the IQ level of the help was very low.  Bathrooms are usually clean.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I've been to the summerlin location so to find out that there was a second one on spring mountain was pretty cool. They took over what use to be Maple Tree Cafe. 

I like how they have citrus water in their restaurant! The service was great and the staff were super friendly. 

I wanted to get something different do I got the chicken wings with a side of kimchi. The chicken had a sweet taste to it. It was crunchy and juicy as well. I enjoyed every bite of it. The worker also gave us free samples of mac and cheese and that was amazing as well. I love how everything comes to you hot and fresh!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>UPDATE 2/8/06

Well, I had to take a star off because the Spanish Latte at LGO (Le Grande Orange) seriously kicks ass.  I hate to say it, but Hava Java just can't hold a candle to it.  But I still really like Hava Java for coffee and it is a nice place to sit.  It also had the bonus of being connected to a genuine gelatoria.


++++++++++++++

The best coffee I have had in Phoenix.  I wouldn't give it 5 stars in the greater coffee universe, but it is way better than what you will find at Starbucks or Coffee Plantation (which hardly qualifies as coffee in my book).  Until I find better in Phoenix/Scottsdale I will let the rating stand.  Bonus points for being connected to a gelato shop.  Baked goods/pasteries are average.  Pleasant atmosphere.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The reviews I'm reading on the Rack Shack! don't do this place justice.  I'm sitting at home after a long night having some of the best potato salad and black eyed peas in the valley.. it's all about the sides people!!

The meats are good if you hit it early and they're GREAT if you hit it late.. as the night goes on, Rack Shack moves from 4 stars to 5 stars..  of course this is on the Late Night BBQ scale which is admittedly different than the Early Afternoon BBQ scale and the Mid-Day BBQ Scale.

Speaking of the Mid-Day BBQ Scale.. one of the worst places I've dined for BBQ lately is Dickey's BBQ.  what a joke that place is... Rack Shack has Dickey's Beat Hands Down.

Bonus! - I've prepared this rhyme to help you remember where they're located... Rack Shack Snack Attack.. get it rhyme, rhythm room? ... man... this review needs to end!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I do not have nearly the good story to tell about Friday's Front Row as Political Junkie Z did...  But we did see a great game there and ate some pretty decent food. 

Friday's Front row is an open-air Friday's above the left field bleachers, and the coolest part is, you don't need a game ticket. I mean, where else can you get this kind of seat without spending thousands of dollars on a fancy skybox? The food may not be fantastic but it sure beats a lukewarm rubbery stadium vendor hot dog any day.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Once upon a time there was a girl called Jen. Jen loved books and reading and the theatre and anything that took her to another imagined world, space and time. Especially the romanticised times of days gone by.

How happy was Jen, then, to one evening be accompanied by very good friends to the Lyceum Theatre for one of the most splendid, exciting, memorable and all round awesome evenings in a long while.

It has all that is good and right about old-world traditions made modern in our near-on space age era (compared to what the Victorians were used to, we're practically the Jetsons.)

Contrast the square, all-glass exterior of the entrance to the plush royal blue and gold painted interior; and most especially the exquisite chandelier hanging, pride of place, in the theatre itself. Anyone who has seen Phantom of the Opera will know how important a chandelier is to a theatre.

Some old-world, listed buildlings have the charm but lack the comfort. Clean toilets or warm rooms are sacrficied for beautiful cornicing. Not at the Lyceum. It was beautifully presented and maintained, a gorgeous modern entrance, warm, nice bathrooms, easily acccesible bar, really attentive friendly staff -and still with the historical features to give it romance and class.

I came to see The Infamous Brother's Davenport here, running in February 2012. A Victoriana play based on the true story of the Davenport Brothers who could communicate with the dead (allegedly). Wonderful setting, brilliant actors, captivating plot. If you are reading this review in February 2012, go -go now. If you aren't, go to the Lyceum anyway for a play that tickles your fancy; regardless of the play, I'm sure you'll fall in love with the theatre itself.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Not bad! I ordered the Sisig and Chicken Adobo (but the girl gave me Menudo ). Sisig was not what I was used to. The pork and tomatoes were cut bigger than I've normally seen. Both were good. Not as good as Moms home cooking but good. I will definitely be going back to try more. Try it out and support our Filipino Community</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The ground's gone sour at this plantation. The coffee isn't the best, but if carrot cake is your scene, man, then it's worth checking out. 

Located at the Biltmore Fashion Park, parking is usually an issue. Since they're open until midnight, you can get a decent parking spot sometime around half an hour before closing. 

The crew on hand is usually a little surly and sometimes a little scary. I've coined a new word that will cover this breed of counter worker: "scurly". Maybe it's not new, nor does it make any sense but in my fragile mind, it sums up the attitude I usually encounter on the rare occasions I go anymore. 

As I just mentioned, they are open until midnight so it's a decent place to go meet up with some friends after hours if you aren't a fan of bars and smoke... or Denny's and Applebees... or good coffee.

    <review:review_text>I love this place! I think the staff struggle to understand what I am looking for sometimes, but they are super helpful!1st time I went in here I spent about 30mins just wondering around looking at all the mental stuff they had.... like the poster below I am vegetarian too, so I had to try all the crazy mock meat (fake duck anyone?) &amp; almost every time I go I come out with something new to try. Prices are good, they offer a small student discount too (5%, but every little helps!)  . A couple of times i've been they have run out of the one thing I am after but usually they are well stocked in most of their items! Defiantly worth a look, if just to see all the awesome different foods out there!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Stopped by for their grand opening last night and had a great night. Never been to a PT's before so I figured this was a perfect opportunity to check it out, even though it was far SW. Apparently this place used to be an O'Aces tavern, but you would've never guessed it because the inside looked brand new and was not smoky at all. We arrived at 7 pm, about an hour late for the event and it was already packed inside! So packed that it took a while to squeeze into the bar area to place drink orders. Eventually we were able to track down a waitress to take care of us the rest of the night, otherwise there would've been a lot of waiting at the bar!

They had a couple specials going on including $2 Stellas and $1 vodka or tequila shots...which were kinda gross, but hey it was only a buck! The gf had a couple of signature cocktails, which were full price but wasn't bad at $6-7.50 each. There were a couple of Stella girls promoting their beer and handing out gifts to people drinking Stellas. We got a Stella chalice glass and a bottle opener for pounding down Stella pints all night long.

The bar area is big, and there are non gaming seats for those that just want to have a drink or watch the game. There is also a small seating area to the right of the bar for dining and another dining area just to the left of the restrooms. Overall seems like a pretty nice place to hang, especially with the 2 pool tables and a small patio area with gas heaters, which is where we sat despite the light rain. The staff was friendly and fast once they actually got to you and I don't see it being as packed on normal nights here. 

They have happy hour from 5 to 7 PM and again later on in the evening, featuring 50% off drinks and pizzas, so I'll have to come back to check that out in the future!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>4 stars with the caveat that Madison pizza in general is pretty bad. 

Rostai's is the best 'cheap' every day pizza place in Madison.  Lombardinos's pizza is better as is Greenbush's.  But for easy delivery and reasonable prices Rosati's is good.  

They're a little bit light-handed on the toppings and the crust is not great (but its thin and crispy).  The cheese and the sauce make the pizza.  

They have specials and coupons on their website.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We went to the new location for the first time for dinner.  Hope tonites service isn't typical, because it was awful.  Food was decent. and out waiter was nice but really slow.  Also we ordered the rice ball. which was listed as coming with sauce and cheese.  When it came to the table it had meat in it.  Just a heads up to any vegetarians which come to this restaurant,   confirm the dish doesn't have meat in it.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is my FIRST Chinese Restaurant experience in Arizona. They have $3.99 lunch special !!!

I said to myself, I have to try it. So I did :-))

I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken. It was pretty good, they had enough chicken on the dish that I did not have to send out a search party to look for them.

For $3.99 this is a good meal. Try it out. It just might surprise you.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Nasty! Worst Mexican food ever!! I rarely give out bad reviews... but this place deserves it!! First off, I know food in Vegas can be a bit overpriced, but this place is the worst ever! First off, the service was terrible! I know it's a fast food type of place but that doesn't mean you need to be so rude when taking orders! Besides, this place is inside a hotel so service should be better anyways! Not all the workers were rude, but the girl taking orders and training the new workers was the worst. She snapped at not only the customers but also the people she was training and talked to people as if they were stupid and didnt understand English. The prices at this place are ridiculous go what you get- the worst tasting Mexican food ever! It was $10 for a burrito and the burrito was so gross. The food here is ridiculously dry! The burrito has rice (no flavor), choice of meat (I got a little bit of each - steak was disgusting dry, bland, and waaaaay overcooked. The other meats tasted sweet like dessert-gross!), beans, and cheese. We also got a taco platter for my friend's daughter. Worst tacos ever! My friend's daughter about choked on it because it was sloppily dry! All they put on it was a few shreds of cheese... and like 3 pieces of carne asana... NO lettuce! We couldn't believe it! I have never seen a taco so dry and stingy. It felt like the stuff was being weighed by the ounce! Look at my pictures if you don't believe how gross they are! There are other foods in the food court here at MGM. Go eat at the others ones! They are so much better. Also, everything here costs extra... and its super expensive too!  Something standard and simple as sour cream costs extra... and it was $1 for a tiny scoop! I will never never ever eat at this place again! Not only was it bad food, but it was terrible service AND expensive! If I could give this place negative stars, I would!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>So I am at the Phoenix Airport. I go through the Business class line and get a hankering for ice cream. I am an hour and a half early and no one is in my line. I yelp what to do next.... I see there is a highly rated creamery in terminal B. I am in Terminal C. That sounds close, right?

Nope.

10 minutes of walkways later I arrive. It is tiny but mighty. There are many freshy creamed ices and smells of waffle cones waft from the entry. I got the espresso and prailine. They were both delish. I finished my entire 2 scoops before I got back to my terminal. The C terminal is Southwest and the B terminal is American/US AIrways. Because it was great and I had a craving, it was worth the walk. The price was very good for such great ice cream.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I've noticed that a lot of my yelp's begin with 'i went on a date here once' ...and this is no different...

So, I went on a date here once! The first thing that struck me was the size - it is huge! But really nicely decorated. It looks out onto the canal (yeah, I didn't know there was a canal in Edinburgh either) and has a lovely outdoor seating area.

BUT..... I've been a few times at the weekend and it's always absolutely dead! There is no atmosphere and hardly anybody there! As a result all the drinks were extortionately priced - but as I was on a date I didn't have to pay (score!) . The mojito's were good....not the best but ok, definitely not worth £8 each.

Overall, it's a nice place but has no atmosphere. If you like a bit of life in a bar, don't hit Cargo!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Very nice  evening tonight at Southern Rail, delicious southern-inspired food, great atmosphere. Quite impressed with the entire place having hit the ground running after only a couple of days. The space is beautifully designed with interesting touches, and is slightly elevated from Camelback road which gives it a nice view of the surrounding area (without the sometimes grimy reality of west camelback road). Extensive beer selection with some southern favorites, as well as a wine list that should suit anyone. The menu is southern, so if you're looking to go "light" you might be better off elsewhere. We had the tomato and bacon tart which was decadent. We also had the gumbo which had perfectly smoky flavor and a not too thick roux. We did not think the three tiny head-on shrimp were worth the $6 supplement, however. Finally, the pork loan was delicious with a smoky, candied flavor and delicious sweet potatoes. Desserts looked wonderful but we couldn't muster another bite. A couple of kinks with service and timing that we can overlook because it has been open less than a week, but overall a wonderful night at a place that is definitely on our rotation from here on! Excited to try the rest of the menu, as we'll be back many times.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Agreed with Dave's review about the staff and service being a hit or miss. I normally don't make stops anymore to cold stone restaurants because their ice cream is so expensive. Plus, I don't care for the taste of their ice cream. Maybe it is just me, but I think it's overrated.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>If you can navigate your way through the thirty page menu, you'll find that they actually have some great offerings at the Cheesecake Factory. Portions are huge, usually amounting to atleast two or three meals for yours truly, so taking that into consideration the prices aren't bad. 

Appetizers are all tasty, and their versatility on the rest of menu is really quite impressive. My favorite two things on the menu are the fish tacos and the orange chicken. They have completely different flavors and creative takes on traditional dishes. 

It's very corporate, and the rumor on the grapevine is that although it's pretty good money, working there is no fun.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I had a friend visiting from England who came to meet me with shock that there was a bar called The He Brides and was that bar for transexual brides? I was totally confused until he took me here and I explained that The Hebrides were islands off the West Coast of Scotland. Not pronounced He Brides. So obviously we had to go in.

The bar is really small and quite dingy. It is filled with regulars who upon hearing my friends English accent struck up the old Braveheart conversation. It was all in good humour and they were all quite friendly. Drinks were fine and reasonably priced too. Now if I am waiting for a train at Waverley and fancy a drink I will often pop in here. Its one of the most real Edinburgh bars with real Edinburgh people that you will get in the city centre, so worth popping in just to see the difference between a small, local pub and the corporate, chain pubs which now litter Edinburgh.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I did not know  what Shawarma was, but now I am a big fan. The Greek salad with Beef was awesome! I already ate there a second time and had the Beef Shawarma sandwich, again awesome. The food is very fresh. This is not fast food, this is good, healthy food fast. Cannot wait to try the baked chicken and rice.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>As wonderful ice cream as you'll find anywhere.  Creamy and sweet with a variety of creative flavors.  Tastes truly hand-made.  During the holiday season, they come out with a special egg-nog that is better than any I've had.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We tried a lunch here not knowing what to expect. Expect that you will get a delicious satisfying meal, well worth the price. Various members of the wait staff kept stopping to ask if we needed anything.y girl friend and I both had the chicken special cooked with garlic herbs and a mango glaze sauce. Not only was it delicious but the asparagus spears and potatoes filled the plate. The plates are deceptively small because neither of us could finish the meal.
    All in all, if you want a nicer meal than the usual, the Market Grill is the place.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Slower than molasses. We ordered a four piece star chicken for our son. It took twenty minutes in the drive thru line just to get it. Good thing we didn't order anything else. This place is horrible. It's not like they're actually cooking anything inside... Don't understand why it's always consistently so slow.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We love the Cash. It is one of the few bars that have a smoking patio that you can drink on.

We have donated a lot of stuff to raffle off for charity events at the Cash. They always have a great turnout.

The crowd is extremely diverse. The drinks are good and cheap, and the bar staff is very friendly.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME
Been to this one multiple times and the one at Palace but the Palace Station one sucks sucks sucks

Have to give it 5 stars for exceeding expectations by a ridiculous amount. It's not in the nicest part of town, hell it's also in a casino, but once your inside MOST of that doesn't matter. Once there were a couple trashy women in torn jean shorts and dirty white tees, blech.

Of course went on a date-

Anyway... food gets 3.5 stars for being above average and prices are surprisingly low for the portions.

Service = 5 stars, the waiter we had (and ask for) was excellent. Far better than you would think, i had to leave an exceptional tip he was attentive, genuinely wanted to be there and serve, and somehow convinced us to get dessert which is rare for me to agree with! (He wheeled out a dessert cart, which looked yummy, and we had the canoli? and it was superb!) Once had a female who seemed un-enthused but lets let that one slide.

Decor gets a 5, really really set the romantic mood and just being there made me and my girl giddy and cute right off the bat.

WORTH IT, GREAT TIME more than once!!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Formally Coco's, now the Grand Cafe. 

I'm a few miles away from Boulder Station and came to have something to eat right quick. I didn't feel like anything else that was open in the area or cooking. Metro Pizza sounded great but they were already closed, so I went next door. 

The place looks much more nice than the Coco's that use to occupy this space. All the tables were set nicely, new paintings on the wall, and smiles on the employees faces. The service was very good. My drink was constantly full and I got my appetizer soup promptly after ordering. 

The menu had reasonable prices and the food looked great. The Prime Rib Special looked very good, but that is until 11pm and it was already after midnight. Instead I went with a Bacon Cheeseburger with seasoned fries. The burger was a very good size and filling, I didn't even finish it! It came with thick cut bacon, slice of cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and onions. The fries were hot and good. 

Overall, the food was basic and good. What stood out most was the service they provided. They are really putting in a good effort to make this place more customer friendly with excellent service. I will revisit and try the Prime Rib next time.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Sunday. 6:20pm. Downtown following another amazing Mercury victory.  Hungry.  Group includes toddler. We'd like to walk to food but it's warm so we can't walk far.  It's sad how few options actually presented themselves.  We tried Coach and Willy's first, but as of 6:10 their kitchen was closed.  So, we were led back to Hard Rock Cafe.

I've been here several times after games and all for the same reasons.  It's close. We didn't feel like parking again. The food is ok.  Think Apple-bee's for a few bucks more.  But service unfortunately has been a regular issue.

One of the last times we were there we advised our server that we needed to be out the door in 45 minutes.  We asked what food we could order to ensure that it would be fast.  To his credit he checked in the kitchen.  After immediately ordering a sandwich and salad, the food arrived 5 minutes before we were supposed to walk out the door with no apology (and a server who hid from us for most of that time). We were 15 minutes late leaving just trying to get to-go containers and our bill.  

This time - our service was actually wonderful.  Our server was great.  Happy, conversational, refilled drinks much more than usual though the place was quite busy with post-game activity.  The problem came when she had to leave to move her car. You see, with D-Back and Merc games, parking was expensive and full so she had to park several blocks away where the gate closed promptly at 8pm, which we totally understood.  And even though we all saw her handing us off to the manager after handing us the check (she pointed to our table several times) no one came to our table.  Well, after flagging down a hostess, a bus boy and another server who all said they would look for the manager, and we did see them scurrying around looking for the manager, it took 25 minutes to find her and have her walk over to the table.  That's 25 extra minutes with a toddler who was getting tired. How much did we love that? Finally, as our waitress walked back into the building 30 minutes after she left, we were finally paying our bill and leaving the table.  She was so apologetic.   She was wonderful.  The fact that we heard from several folks there that waiting 20 minutes to FIND the manager was not out of the norm was scary. 

They have such an amazing location in the heart of the action after events.  Their food is decent enough that I'd be willing to grab something there again purely for convenience if only I knew what to expect when it came to the service.  But unfortunately - I can't.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We thought we would start our day off with a short trip from downtown Las Vegas . . . and 4 miles away sits this small dive bar . . . with cheap cold beer . . . that is if they would have CO2.  Are you kidding me . . . a bar running out of CO2 . . . you are either a really busy and great dive bar . . . or . . . you have problems.  Sorry to say . . . I believe it's the latter.

Anyways . . . we stopped in mid morning and there were plenty of locals playing the slots . . . so it is truly hard to judge what this place would be like a night with Karaoke and a DJ . . . but I just can't get pass the fact that they ran out of CO2.

Will I ever be back . . . probably not . . . but if I do . . . I would be at night to see if this place is any better at another time of day.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Cheesy and totally overrated - the carribean fare in a Jimmy Buffet inspired setting is all good in theory, but the colorful interiors and catchy tunes are little compensation when you spend most of your time keeping flies away from your crappy food and balancing the BAD shaka-ritas (margarita flights) on creaky wooden tables in the patio.
The food was uniformly ordinary - my vegetarian baja burger was way too spicy to be enjoyable, the crab-cake burger was a disaster and I left my fries practically untouched, which hardly ever happens! Overall, one of the worst restaurant experiences for me.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Back in the day, The Spider's Web was the place to be seen for a particular type of Edinburgh gentleman. It's typical punter was permanently on disability benefit, had a severe alcohol problem, and would often spend 12 hours a day in here, drinkling heavily and soiling himself, in order to escape from his battleaxe of a wife. In turn, she'd spend most of her days chain smoking and having unprotected, disesase ridden sex with various men she met down the Jobcentre.

It also had a cult following amongst nightclub revellers whom were just a bit too keen to stay up all night and damage their internal organs further. Sadly, both customer bases seem a bit thin on the ground  these days, but fingers crossed it can ride out the storm and return to glories past.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is not Chicago style. Ordered an Italian beef and polish dog. Neither reminded me of Chicago. Polish tastes more like a regular hot dog and after 2 bites, I couldn't eat it anymore. Italian beef was ok but like how my boyfriend pointed it out, it's not soggy or good enough. Even the beer tastes funky. Ordered a blue moon and returned it for a colors light but it was still tasting wrong.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>In my constant search for newer, faster, and more interesting routes on my commute to work from CenPho to Tempe, I've been passing by Rosita's a lot recently, and coerced my husband, who came home the other night and said, "Carolina's?" to try Rosita's instead. Boy, was I sorry. 

Let's start with the mariachi musicians who stood so closely behind me that they completely invaded my "stranger bubble" and I was forced to move my seat at the table. Next, there were the chips which were just ok to begin with, and ended with gobs of congealed grease after they had cooled a tad. Then, hubby's machaca chimi was fine, with decent flavor, but my pork carnitas was so dry it was literally inedible. You could look at it and see that the sliced pork was so dry it was like the dessicated flesh at the Body Worlds exhibit. Gross, I know, but so was this meat. It simply should not have been served by a conscientious restaurant. 

Next time, I won't contest it when Hubby suggests Carolina's (who serves the best chimis and by far the best tortillas in town).</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>If you love Mexican food... REAL Mexican food, and you don't want to go out to eat every night, you need to start shopping at a carniceria. Carneceria means 'meat market' in Spanish, or so I so I am told. Most carnicerias I have been in over my lifetime are more like a small grocery store... Los Compadres #3 is, in my opinion, the best in town... 

I have only gotten the pre-marinaded chicken and steak (carne asada) here. They pound the meat thin and use a very tasty, not too spicy marinade so all you have to do is slap the meat on a preheated grill for a few minutes on each side. 

In the back of the store there is a service counter where you can buy premade food. Yummy taquitos and excellent rice. Great pico de gallo, and the guacamole is very tasty.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>First time at this cart. Great experience. Staff was friendly and helpful. I opted for the jalepeno popper sandwich because it's first on the menu (and I plan to work my way thru it). 

It was nicely grilled. Perfect, in fact. Gooey cheese and big slices of jalepeno. Delicious bread. A little cup of tomato soup for dunking on the side. 

There are some great food carts on the square. This is looking to be a new favorite.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Deli Fresco is in a great location for satisfying your hunger pangs after a harrowing trek up Leith Walk.  I came here earlier this year after a long day at the shops it was a tasty and value-for-money meal.  Inside it feels fresh and clean with both indoor and outdoor seating.  The service is welcoming, friendly and seems to take your order and make the food much faster than anywhere else.
In the front counter they have an impressive selection of cakes and muffins which all seem pretty reasonably priced.  They also serve paninis, sandwiches, baguettes and toasties, most of which costing no more than £3.  I had a meatball with cheese panini which tasted amazing, took virtually no time to prepare and cost only about £3.50 with a can of coke as well. I would definitely go to Deli Fresco again as I couldn't fault its service or its range and quality of food.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>By far, the best pizza pies in Madison. Their crust and sauces are exceptional. This Italian joint is decidedly old school. Cheese is spread and calories and fat phobes are not spared. 

Much of the staff is young, but are all friendly enough. However, you don't come here too feed your ego ... just your face. 

Rosati's has a massive menu, but you cannot go wrong with any of it. In fact, if you order their sensational Italian sausage, you can't help but go right. 

Eat up and leave your calorie counter at home ... or else it may explode.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Texaz is fun!  I grew up in Texas and this is the real deal.  The chicken fried steak is my fave.

But, last night, Mom and I hit Texaz for dinner and decided to share the fried shrimp platter.  Each shrimp is as big as your head!  Ok, maybe not, but they are a good size, about 3-4 inches.  For $15 is was a deal.  I added an extra salad for $2.

All dinners come with salad, choice of potatoes (fried or mashed -- the fried potatoes are chunks of potatoes, deep fried; the mashed are still a bit chunky with white gravy), and a roll and a biscuit.

The salad is basic -- iceberg lettuce and tomatoes.  Ranch or olive vinaigrette for dressing.  The olive is great!

Shiner bock is the house beer for $3.25 a bottle, other domestics are $2.75 each and imports are $3.75.

Our dinner, two salads, 2 Coors lights and one JD on the rocks was $29 including the tip.

Yee haw!
Y'all come back now, y'hear?!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I lived near the Monroe St. location and frequented this place regularly.  Everything is super fresh and authentic. I was always a big fan of the crawfish etoufee with a big slab of cornbread.  The spice could be a little inconsistent though, which is probably a result of having super fresh spices one time and then not the next time.  No big deal though as it was always delicious either way. I regret that I have never had a po' boy from this place, but that is something I will have to remedy ASAP. I also wish that it was easier to eat at the place. I know it is takeout, but it always sucked having to walk home smelling the beautiful aromas roll out of the box. Or, alternatively when it was 40 below/snowing/raining/etc.</review:review_text>

Never had a bad dish.  I recommend the #14 on toast.  Also the B.B.C.T.O without the T&amp;O (Bagel, Bacon, Cream Cheese) breakfast is amazing!  I am craving it right now.  

However,.... I can't get it because the line is out the door this morning and there is only one person working. With the addition of 110 employee company in the building the wait is ridiculous.  Even if I call ahead and wait 20 minutes before I go down. I still end up waiting ANOTHER 20 minutes for a sandwich. 

This has been happening on a regular basis now.  Please HIRE SOMEONE.  I hear lots of rumblings while waiting in line, so the frustration is not just me.  I think once the wait goes back to normal I will update with more starts.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The best. Nothing tops these burgers. Jazz fries are a most as long as the fryer is working.(only been down twice of around 15 times or so.) No matter what you order it is amazing.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I've always been treated just fine here, but on Tuesday, May 29, 2012, I had the HONOR of meeting GINA.

I had a rather LARGE order of chicken planks to pick up for myself and some friends, and GINA went out of her way to not only give me the chicken, but ALSO to give me a few additional "goodies" to apologize for my having to wait so long for my food.

I tried to explain that, "the longer it takes, the FRESHER and HOTTER it will be," and that I really didn't mind waiting as long as I did (in my car, after ordering at the drive-through), but GINA wouldn't hear of it.  She insisted (in a most pleasant, friendly and polite way) that I accept the "extras," so I did.

GINA (an African-American girl, in case there is more than one GINA there), is an excellent example why I will ALWAYS go to that specific LJS location, when given a choice.

Dedication to complete customer service is what GINA is all about, and I bet that one day, she will be the General Manager of her own LJS location.

She's certainly got MY VOTE!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Don Guido's is Sunnyslope's hot dog place.  I'm not especially a hot dog gal, but Don Guido's offers something else to Sunnyslope too: Italian Beef sandwiches! 

This was my lunch today: a delicious Italian beef sandwich paired with garlic fries! The beef in my sandwich was not fatty or metallic colored like I've experienced in other places. I really enjoyed it and will definitely have it again (but will probably ask for it a little more wet, next time)! 

But, seriously, let me tell you about those fries...!!! Don Guido's garlic fries exceeded my expectations!! The fries were nice and crisp, not greasy. And, while I expected a shake of garlic salt to qualify for "garlic fries," I was delighted to find them topped with REAL minced garlic and parsley. A lot of it too! People were coming into my office from down the hall to get in on the action! 

We've polished them off, so you'll have to make a run to Don Guido's and get your own. TOTALLY worth the trip!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Their slogan says it all:  The Best Little Brewhouse in the West!  Terrif food!  Great service! Reasonable prices.  Nice combination.

Beer is brewed on-site. It's on-draft, &amp; they *even* have DRAFT RootBeer!  [YUM!]

BTW, if you can't get 2 meals out of their Kobe beef burger, metinks you're eatin' too much!   :-)

Once, when the soup-of-the-day was lentil (I love lentils) in a tomato broth, it was so good, I had to order another bowl to take home (it was great right outta the refrig!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>There are certain things that I am particularly sensitive to and the first is lead by my nose. I have one hell of a sniffer and as I have admitted in prior discussions in this open forum, my nose can be a nuisance. Today as we were out celebrating the holiday at the Biltmore Fashion Park and looking for a light bite, maybe even a glass of wine or bubbles, we decided to stop upstairs to Christopher's. It has been several months since my last visit and recently - in one of last week's discussions - I strongly encouraged a fellow SF yelp-er to visit Christopher's. I thought it would be wise to revisit a place I have genuinely enjoyed. 

Now, before I continue, I agree, Christopher's can have, what I refer to as, disconnected service. And, when I am on the receiving end and being disconnected, I force a connection - especially if I want to engage conversation and have questions answered from the service team. That being said, we walked in, asked to sit at the bar and for menus and a wine list.

They were going to disconnect us. Yeah, not going to happen. We were in a chatty mood and we wanted, very badly to have one glass of champagne and to be full of cheer. I ordered two glasses of Tattinger Rose Special Cuvee and as I sat for my friend to return from the restroom, I couldn't get past the smell. I know that smell. I used to work at an older Tempe bar and I know the smell of well - I know the smell. And, I also know the lovely perfume that should be enjoyed with this champagne, that wasn't happening either because I was distracted. As my friend returned and sat down, she said "Does it smell funky in here." Thank goodness, she smells it too. Its not just my obnoxious sniffer. I opted that we move outside.

At this point, I let the bartender know why we were moving. I am of the thought that you should responsibly let the service team or management know when something really displeases you or distracts you from a moment. Restaurants, lounges and bars are in the business not of just food and wine, but of making memories. And a memory shouldn't stink.

So, I casually said something to the bartender know and we moved outside. And, although we disconnect ourselves with the odor, our service stayed connected. We enjoyed our glass of champagne and moved on and through our shopping extravaganza. 

I hope that our fellow SF Yelper didn't receive any funky odor and that it was a stale rarity. And for now, I'll give Christopher three stars.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>My Mamma loves this place and always wants to go here when she comes to visit. I think its partly due to the handy 50% off voucher La Tasca email me every month. Otherwise I don't think we would bother.

We usually go around 12 and this place is always dead, but it slowly fills up so it's not all bad. It has a nice, warm Spanish-themed decor which can almost make you feel like you're in sunny Spain. Almost. For some reason it is always the same waiter in here, maybe they only have one? But we always seem to get the same guy, who I think might be Spanish.

The menu boasts an array of Tapas dishes to suit every sort of eater. A great selection of meat, fish, vegetarian and salad dishes so you are bound to find something. It can be hit or miss though, sometimes the Paella is great and sometimes it is very dry and bland. I love the Chorizo cooked in red wine and the Patatas Bravas. At lunchtime they offer a deal of 5 dishes for two people for £10. Which is okay and there is a good selection but with the handy 50% off voucher we tend to stick to the normal menu as there is more choice and it works out roughly the same price.

This restaurant has a nice atmosphere and is good for a quiet lunch where you can end up stuffing your face on the cheap.</review:review_text>

Let me be truthful, I am comparing the Silver Dragon Chinese Restaurant(SDCR) to the last place(Dragon Chinese Restaurant...yes very similar name) that was in this very building less than a month ago in this review.   

My family and I saw some immediate changes as we walked into SDCR.  They have way more staff than the previous owners.  As you're seated they are at your table in a flash taking your drink order...good right!?   Less than a minute later you are smothered by the service!  I did not like that SDCR is doing everything it can to keep the presentation of the previous place.  Resembling business name, no change to the exterior nor the interior and identical menu with the exception of higher costs.  OK back to the review...a minute after getting the drinks we were confused from the sense of déjà vu!  So we order an appetizer to give ourselves some time to get our bearings.  I kid you not, a second server approaches up within a minute of placing our APP order.  I am getting pissed and told the second waitress we're not ready and was really considering paying for the drinks and appetizer and getting out of Dodge!  The suspense of tasting a few of the regular items we used to order from Dragon Chinese Restaurant to see if SDCR could replicate kept us in our seats.  As we are discussing which items to get we kept hearing people arriving after us asking if this was the same place or asking for the previous employees.  The new crew had the mantra of, "we are owned by the same owner" and "we have better food".  Before the appetizer hits the table we were asked to place our order two more times since my last account.  We finally are placing our order as the APP hits the table.

We order Crab Puffs...they had the same appearance and taste, but the serving size went from 8 pieces to 6 pieces at a higher cost.  They brought our order of Chicken Fried Rice and it looked like it should have.  Again the portion shrunk, this time the flavor was off...way off.  I normally do not use soy sauce on my fried rice but this time it was needed because it was bland.  Along with the lack of flavor the peas and carrots were cool not completely cooked.  Next we have our Shrimp Chow Fun, can you guess if the trend will continue...yes smaller portions.  This is not a saucy dish and noodles are dry, I know this but the underside of the noodles were not coated with the sauce which made this dish under spiced too!  While we were eating we overheard a customer from the previous place give specific instructions with his add-ons along with what the previous restaurant charged for the add-ons.  My family and I got a kick out of this guy and chuckled.  My daughter said that the guy was her "spirit animal",kids say the funniest things sometimes.  

My family and I were very critical with SDCR because we REALLY LIKED Dragon Chinese Restaurant.  SDCR has lost our family's go to status.  Will we ever return, sure to see if they get better whenever in the area.  We will no longer make a special trip from Avondale to eat here.  If I did not compare it to one of my once favorite places, I would give it three stars.  At this point it is very average but it is also their first week being opened.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Nice place, packed on the soft opening. The vigazz burger was tasty, but I thought the wings were the highlight - my friend loved his fish tacos 

Our server Kelsey was very nice and accommodating, especially considering it was so busy.

My only qualm was the misters were angled down on tables and very powerful, soaking our table, and two members in our party-
We asked to move inside, but they ended up turning off the misters-I felt really bad because it affected other people, but I could tell some were relieved as the ladies hair was getting frizzy</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>There is no better liquor store anywhere. The service is friendly, the options are extensive and the prices are reasonable. Several years ago my boyfriend and I stopped in to buy a case of wine for a wedding gift. We really don't know a whole lot about wine, so Adam hand picked the perfect case within our budget. Our friends said it was some of the best wine they had ever had, and they visit the Bay Area on a regular basis. Thank you Adam, for making us look really good. They often have tastings of beer, wine and port. Great Taste of the Midwest tickets are sold here too! They actually personally wished me a happy birthday via myspace. Star Liquor rocks.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Don't park your car and expect it to be there when you come out after eating there.  They towed my car today because I did not eat in the restaurant.  Unfortuantly we did eat there and could not get out of the parking lot because of event across the street.  So we walked around the nuthouse01area for a bit came back and car was gone. Talked to manager who said we did not eat there and I showed receipt and was told that was I was not seen on some camera so I did not eat there.  Now have to wait until Monday to get my car.  Well thats it never eat here again.  

Lost customer for ever Wendy'  Wish Dave were alive he would have treated customer much differently.
Shame on Wendy's</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I love love love this place. If I could afford it, I would eat here more often. The sandwiches are fabulous. Best ingredients out there and amazing breads. You can also pretty much add/exclude anything you want to any sandwich. The soups are always delicious, as well as their side salads and pastas. 

I love the feeling and atmosphere of the place. Very homey and welcoming. They also have several different patios around the restaurant, which is nice. Not to mention a glorious cheese selection, wine/beer bar, and espresso. 

It's a bit pricey, and if you go during the lunch hour any day of the week (including weekends), especially during the nice season, expect to wait more than just a few minutes for your food. Otherwise, though, this place is a hidden (it's tucked away in the plaza) wonder.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is the residence of Queen when she is visiting Scotland. I walked here from near Edinburgh Castle. It was a nice walk. The grounds are beautiful, and their are tons of cool statues to look at. I wanted to walk up the hill and have a hike but I was too tired and wearing suede boots that I didn't want to muddy. I definitely recommend seeing this as part of your Edinburgh experience.

Minus one star for not being allowed to go into the castle and take a nap on the Queen's bed and use her bathroom.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We were excited for this place to open and we left pretty impressed, especially since they just opened. 

Pros - Beer selection is what you come here for - period. They let us try anything, which was amazing. All the other tap rooms usually charge for tastes. The food menu is limited, but the prime rib sandwich at the pretzels were both good. The pizza, with pretzel crust, was so-so. Wait staff was delightful, owner was nice. We sat outside which was lovely. 

Cons - The inside is mostly high tables. I prefer low. It is also on the small side, so I would be worried to try to meet here with a large group. 

We will be back!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I'm no shave-and-a-haircut snob, and to be perfectly honest, I generally find the cheapest barber shop or salon I can. After coming here, I don't think I'll be doing that anymore.

For an exceedingly reasonable price, the owner spent over a half  hour on my not particularly difficult hair. The ambiance in a barber shop is particularly important, and although I came when it was not crowded, I still felt comfortable--enough so that when he had finished cutting my hair, I decided that I'd get my goatee trimmed at the same time. Let me tell you--he put my home grooming efforts to shame.

There's nothing like a hot towel massage, a straight razor, and high-quality lather to put you in a good mood for the day. I was debating going to the a nationwide haircutting chain a few blocks away, but I'm glad I came here. Seriously, it's only $4 more to come here for a standard haircut, and worth every penny.

BTW-- Yes, he's definitely from NYC, and he's probably Jewish. I don't know about you, but I like my pizzas, my sandwiches, and my barbers to be both.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Do not stretch your arms out wide at this place.

It's a small joint, so I thought they would have some kick ass food.  Wellllll....because the lady who tended to us was so nice I really don't want to speak ill of the joint, but I was hoping to have some good Mexican food like I was used to having in Southern California.  

When I walked in, I could smell the aromas of masa and tortillas in the air.  I thought I was back home.  Not.

The menu was colorful and had a nice variety of choices.  The basics are served here:  tamales, enchiladas, burritos, tacos and breakfast if you're there on time.  

When we were all seated, we were served freshly made corn chips, fresh salsa and drinks.  I chose the chicken enchilada, beef tamale and rice &amp; beans combo.  While waiting for my food, I noticed the restaurant had a personal touch and was kept clean.  It was small and very old, but at least the service was prompt and friendly.  

My food was slightly disappointing in that it was "ok".  I doubt I would go back there, but I wouldn't refuse to go, if that makes any sense.  It didn't blow my dress up, so I just have to go with 3 stars.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Friendly staff. Sushi bar, gelato bar, bbq bar all on site. Fish and meat counters will cook your food for you on the grill. And you can drink booze while you shop. This is a Roundy's superstore, which means the house brand is the old IGA brand, Roundy's. New, shiny, well-stocked, and a great shopping experience. If only it wasn't so far out of my way.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is the place I always used to go to after I left the bars when I was younger.  I remember being so absolutely plastered one afternoon that I sat down and to this day am certain I had two big macs there.  (Any doubt why I quite drinking twenty five years ago???)  Fortunately a professor from ASU wouldn't let me drive for another two hours.

The location is convenient for getting in and out of late at night.

What really makes it interesting is the people from the neighborhood around it. If you are a people watcher you might really like it here.  You just never know what you'll see from the man who regularly parks his wheelchair by the drive through and solicits money to... 

It's nothing special but holds some memories for me.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The chips were good,but is that saying much? I will give them kudos on their service,because they were very attentive. I ordered the carne asada burrito (and you know that's the thing I check for first usually if you are a Mexican establishment) with rice and beans. The burrito was average but the thing that didnt set well for me was their rice. It tasted like it was out the box.  This place has a long way to go to beat Vivo Michocan, Fausto's, Super Mex,etc...</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I am officially a restaurant.com addict. I have been to so many places that I never would have thought to try had it not been for the coupons. Omaha was my latest culinary adventure. We arrived around 7:30 on a Thursday night, the place only had about 4 other tables booked, we nestled in to a booth and remarked on the beauty of the hotel. This Omaha sits inside the Embassy Suites at the Biltmore.

The service was great, our waiter was pleasant and thorough. We started with the shrimp bisque, it was creamy and tangy, but did not have any chunks of shrimp in it. For the main we had the grilled sirloin, wrapped in bacon and pepper-crusted,  everything tastes better wrapped in bacon, it was a little overdone (asked for med-rare, but a nice cut of meat). It came with mashed potatoes and we ordered a side of asparagus, it was fresh and crisp. 

I saw the crème brulee and had to order it. I was surprised at how big it was. About twice the size I am used to seeing, it was a little "eggy", not the creamy custard I am accustomed to but good none the less. 

Overall we had a pleasant meal, and the restaurant.com gave us a nice discount. It still is in a hotel, so I don't know how often I would visit, but it is great for those staying at Embassy Suites.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Ok first off I am thrilled that a brewery finally opened in the west valley. So congrats to the freakin' crew for setting a milestone. I know with a few others on the way, the westside will start getting recognized like it should.

Ok, first impression at pulling into the big commercial warehouse area was ok, took a minute to find the suite they were located, just keep looking left and you'll see it. Walked right in and was greeted by a really friendly bartender, and a vibe of local people wanting to try good craft beer. The setting was ok, some high top tables, barstools, and few chairs. A little cramped so if you're rolling 4 or more somebody might have to stand. Overall a moderately sized tasting room.

Sat down and ordered a 6 beer taster, had very interesting brews from a creme ale to some sort of chocolate stout to something like a hefeweizen.  Not bad, remember folks they're just starting out so I'm sure the have more to come as time rolls on. I'll be sure to stop in here and there to see what new brews they'll make.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The most noticeable demographic at this Coffee Plantation are the bratty teenagers that go there on the weekends, obviously not to drink coffee or listen to acoustic Paul Simon covers. 

I know this because I was one of those teenagers. When I was first in high school, my friends and I pretty quickly figured out that parents had no problem driving us to Coffee Plantation to drop us off for what appeared to be an innocent night of caffeine and maybe even ice cream. What would usually happen, however, was the walk to isolated, unsupervised places where we would congregate and get into all kinds of trouble. Then we would go back to the Coffee Plantation to be picked up and wreak havoc on the innocent customers trying to spend their Friday or Saturday nights there. 

Apparently we weren't the last group to think that it was a good idea. Sorry, folks, but for a laid back coffee night, CP probably isn't your spot .</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Great atmosphere and excellent service. So many restaurants have struggled in this location, I hope Orgeganos makes it. Dave took great care of us. We'll be back!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I'm very firm with my belief that food can only do so much for a restaurant. Shitty service means a shitty review, in my opinion. I agree with both reviews prior to mine, but they should have received way below 4 for it. There are plenty of wonderful French places (Coup des Tartes, Sophie's Bistro) and much better cheese and wine places (Cheuvront), so why waste your time dealing with these asses? Serious. The food is fine, but the service leaves an awful taste.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The food was decent and the ambiance was very nice, but several things happened that made this a 2 star experience.

Preface:  I had purchased several gift certificates from restaurant.com which *in theory* is a great way to save money - spend $10 and get a $25 gift certificate.  It has a bunch of restaurants I like and ones that I wanted to try, including OT.  So I made a reservation for 7:00 on a Friday and went with my husband. 

I didn't even realize that I had made a reservation on a First Friday.  There was a loud party going on in the back and the entire staff seemed a bit flustered catering to them and the normal restaurant crowd.  You'd think they'd have their act together having to deal with First Friday on average of once per month.  Guess not. 

We arrived an hour early in hopes of sitting at the bar to get a feel for the place and take advantage of their happy hour.  This is where the bad experiences started.  I had two glasses of wine and my husband had two top shelf martinis.  When we got the bill, we noticed I had been charged $1 per glass over the price listed in the wine menu, and my husband had been charged full price for the martinis that were supposed to be on happy hour special ($9 each instead of $7).  Very disingenuous, and strike #1.  To the bartender's credit, rather than mess with the computer and get the charges correct, she simply took off one of the glasses of wine, which more than made up for the overcharge.  I wish this had been the only hiccup, but. . . 

Once we were seated at our table, I was overwhelmed by the scent of vanilla.  All of the candles they used on all of the tables were scented!  Anyone that has ever planned a reception with food knows (and every restauranteur should know) that this is a big no-no because the smell of the candles totally alters the taste of the food.  I blew out the candle on our table immediately, but this is strike #2. 

Since we had the gift certificate, we decided to go with a three course meal - soups, apps, entrees.   Amazingly, all of the food came out to the table at the same time.  We had a table full of food getting cold as we started on our soup.  Strike #3.  

As for the food, the french onion soups we had were actually quite good.  The bacon wrapped prawns appetizer was ok, the dipping sauces were nothing special.  My lemon artichoke chicken was also good but my husband's grilled meatloaf, while he enjoyed it, tasted more like Italian sausage.  

Unfortunately, when we got the bill, we again noticed that we had been overcharged on our glasses of wine (different wine than at the bar).  We didn't think much of it this time since we were using the gift certificate anyway.  But here's the icing on the cake - when you use the gift certificate, they add on gratuity based on the original amount of the bill.  Fine, no big deal.  The original bill was $61, so with the $25 certificate it *should* have come to $36 + gratuity.  When we got the revised bill the amount listed $44 and said "($8 included gratuity)".  A few days later, checking my bank statement, I saw OT was kind enough to charge us $52. . .they double charged the gratuity!  $16 tip on a $61 meal!  Effectively making the $25 certificate $17!  Strikes #4, 5, and 6.  Unacceptable. 

If you decide to frequent this establishment, I strongly urge you to double and triple check the charges on your bill and pay in cash so they don't have the opportunity to overcharge your card.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Great food, friendly staff.  I went there a lot when I lived in the area.  The food was great, the only downside is if you don't eat the tacos right away or you get them to go they get a little soggy.  But it is from the fresh salsa, not grease!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Popped in for a quick pint and was pleasantly surprised. It was the pubs opening night, so many other people had the same idea. The decor is standard new bar fare with a few novel touches thrown in. Nice selection of spirits and beers to suit all tastes and budgets. The house lager is £2.50 and is pretty good. There are adverts for cocktails too didnt see any of these getting made, but they look like they take there booze seriously. 

From the face book page they seem to take pride in their food. The menu I am told is meat based however said they would be offering a smoked mushroom burger and  mac cheese sliders. My veggie friends are catered for too. 

All in worth a visit, comfortable pub with good beers. Might need a few more visits to try the food and sample some more brews.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>first off, never had the food here. i have priorities. these priorities kinda go something like this:
1. alcohol/breathing (cant drink if you can't breathe)
2. sleep
3. tivo (god, i love my tivo)
4. food

food is low on the totem pole, but beer would be ranked #1 which is why i do heart the old chicago. i'm a card carrying member of the world beer tour which i find completely awesome. OC has themed beer tours at least once a month. you basically drink the series of beers within the tour, get your tour points on you world beer tour card, and get a neat tshirt (ie st patricks day = who's your paddy? tshirt. awesome.). 

did i mention their ginormous list of beers? yes, ginormous. its a word. i swear. they have a metric ass ton. belgian,german,mexican,canadian,and nicely ghettoized schlitzy goodness. you really can't help but find a beer on their menu that you like. 

so far i havent completed an entire tour ( :( ) but i'm workin on it!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Let me preface this by saying that I'm usually a Burger King guy (I like their mascot better, McDonald's is too funny looking).

However, my friend was in town, and I thought, "why the heck not? live a little!" so I brought her here.

On our way to McDonald's, also known as "Mickey D's" in other areas, I begin to worry that maybe I should have called to reserve a table in advance.

However, upon arriving, we were pleasantly surprised to find no line!! 

We did wait a minute or two to be seated, but apparently, this is one of those seat yourself places.  

As I approached the front, I was immediately mesmerized by their huge selection of burgers. Their menu ranged from McSingles to McDoubles to even McTriples!! They also had a dollar menu consisting of items costing $1.07 after tax. 

I decided to go with their house special, The Big Mac, and their seasonal Chicken "McNugget" Pieces.

When I opened up my box of chicken nuggets, the pale-golden/yellow skin indicated that it had just came out of the storage unit next to the fryer. 
 
As the freshness evaporated with every bite, I really began to taste all the other kinds of meat that went into making the nuggets. I think I even tasted some pork, but don't take my word for it. 

Oh my God and then you have the dipping sauces! These little containers held the perfect blend of artificial sweetener and manufactured taste  

As I eagerly unwrapped my Big Mac, I was slightly disappointed to find that it wasn't as advertised (the picture on the display made it seem a lot bigger!!). Oh well.

I would really like to commend the chef on making the buns just how I like them, extremely soggy. I was even more impressed that the soggy, limp buns were able to maintain their round form. This is some pretty advanced cooking technique!!

Anyways, as I bit into my Big Mac, the first thing I tasted was the mayo. Actually, it was the only thing I tasted, but it was some damn good mayo. 

Finally, if you're watching your waistline, they have a plethora of drink options. Choices like Diet Coke, Diet Coke Zero, Sugar-free Diet Coke Zero, etc... ensures that there's a perfect diet drink for everyone. 

PS: Perfect date spot for Valentine's Day. Highly recommended!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Being a huge fan of Chicago, and the cuisine it creates, I'm always on the prowl for a good Chicago style pizza or hot dog. I stumbled into Johnny's one day on accident after being disgusted by Z Pizza and I'm glad I did. They do the single best reproduction of the true Chicago hot dog I've had in Phoenix. Perfect bun, dog, relish, onions, sport peppers, celery salt, tomato, and pickles. There is no ketchup to be seen, which scored some big points in my book, until I looked around the corner and saw it was served but with french fries... I guess I can let it slide. Johnny is a nice guy and serves great dogs. Can't beleive nobody has reviewed this place yet...</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>OK seriously.  This could be one of Arizona's hidden treasures.  I almost don't want to share this, because it will eventually mean long lines for me.

This is a corner store (appropriately on the corner) of 56th Street and Indian School.  It at some time was probably a 7-11 or Circle K.  But they have THE BEST sandwiches in town.  When you walk in, it's a little sketchy.  So don't say you haven't been warned.  It is a convenience store and in a corner of the store they also happen to make sandwiches.  

If you aren't scared away, then you are in luck, because this corner of the store is where all the magic happens.  You ask the Asian guy at the counter for a slip and you write down your sandwich order.  He then hands it to the Asian guy in the corner who will then make your sandwich.  

They use Boar's Head meats and aren't stingy with it!  I had a roast beef sandwich that had at least 2 inches of meat on it...and with all the toppings, my sandwich was only $6!  

Plus, since it's a grocery store/gas station type place, you can grab some chips, nuts, drinks, beer, wine...whatever you need to go with your sammie.  I passed on the beer/wine since I was headed back to work to eat my sandwich at my desk. I recommend that you too get your sandwich and sides "to go"...since it's a corner store, there is no where to "sit and eat" unless you like eating in your car...and I have a really weird aversion to people who eat in their cars.  OR...you can dine in the AZ summer heat at a picnic table that is in the parking lot.  But, the table was taken today by a truck full of construction workers who obviously also learned about this wonderful sandwich shop.

Anyway, if you work or live in the area, you need to give this place a try...it is truly one of the best sandwiches I've had in at least a year or two.  I will be going back...REAL SOON.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>My boyfriend and I visited this restaurant on Tuesday 18th December, whilst staying in Edinburgh after reading some great reviews on Yelp. I was hankering for some Thai food and decided on this restaurant as the prices seemed very good too. 

We walked from our hotel which was just opposite the Portrait Gallery, and it took between 10-15 mins, which included me tackling cobbled hills in heels in the rain; but boy was the journey worth it! It was 9.40 when we arrived and we had booked our table. The waiter was very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. 

I had the mushroom and coconut milk soup for start which was delicious; this is my favourite thai dish so it had to be had! It was wonderful, one of the best I have had. My boyfriend had the same but without the coconut milk; this was much hotter, but very nice. The waiter warned us of the heat which is good if you don't do well with hot food. 

For mains I had the vegetarian thai red curry which was also very tasty, and had a good kick to it.  The boy had the vegetarian version of the dish with the oyster sauce which was AMAZING! I hadn't tried it before as I tend to stick with what I love in thai food, I would absolutely recommend this dish! 

A few people came in afterwards, so it was nice to have some others eating late, which is something I enjoy about eating in Europe that is missing from the UK. 

I would 100% recommend this restaurant. There were a few Thai eateries in the area and we were both pleased we'd picked this one. A lovely gem in a nice quiet area of Edinburgh.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Um. It's okay, I guess. They have food at decent prices, but the isles are narrow, everything needs a good cleaning and repainting, and it just felt dark and depressing. Otherwise it's all right, but I don't plan on returning here.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We were very pleased with everything. All ingredients were fresh. They serve huge amounts of food. The dinner combos come with egg roll cream cheese puffs lo mein with fried rice. We also got a free order of chicken fried rice.  Our dishes that had chicken was made with chicken breast. That's a plus. I ordered the chicken with veg in white garlic sauce. It was very tasty. Veggies were perfectly cooked still had the fresh crunch but cooked enough where you can taste the name of the dish. Spicy orange chicken was good wasn't overly sweet but had a light kick of the chili flakes. Chicken jalapeño was a little spicy but spicy enough for the person that likes some heat. Chicken and mushroom was really good too.  No can mushrooms used here. I really hope this place sticks around. I like Chinese food and panda express does not do it for me. Yans is near but I am not a fan. All  good Chinese places are ridiculously far. Now maybe I am overly excited to welcome this new establishment but who cares. Give these guys a try maybe for lunch  it's a few bucks cheaper. Let's help keep them in the community. We honestly need something different out here. I will go back. If my experience is any different I will yelp about it.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Smart? Hmmm...maybe. Final? Well, they have a return policy, so not so sure on that. Enjoyable? Pretty much. I'm not a big warehousey shoppy kinda guy. Just like I don't like the HUGE grocery stores and dare I say, frankly, these super monster mega Target stores are little daunting to me. And Costco? Never been? I don't need 48 hot dogs. Nor do I need a gallon of Hidden Valley Ranch. So S &amp; F, has a smaller, more navigatable space. Very organized with prices highly visible. I usually go here for restaurant supplies which are EXPENSIVE. Really...a plastic silverware tray has to cost $32? But they cleaning supplies and paper products are relatively cheap and come in "semi" bulk, so it's not too much. Staff is helpful and knowledgeable, something you don't get at most other stores. And once in a blue moon, they have cool stuff, like hand made wooden bowls marked down from $50 to $12....and it's huge. Sometimes I just sit in it and eat a weenie smothered in ranch dressing! And that's my final answer.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Perfect little shop to go to if you want to pick up some Asian food real fast. Has a little bit of everything in terms of fresh veggies, Asian cutlery and dishes, rices, and frozen goods. I usually stop in here to pick up simple stuff like soy sauce and nori. They do carry a good selection of ramen for those lazy days when you don't want to cook or just need some comfort food, which ramen does for me. I also noticed they have a selection of Sake! I feel like sake is quite hard to come by in this country and they have a little variety . There is also a little fridge that carries all your favourite Asian soft drinks. Best of all, and that I always forget to ask for, is they have a 10% student discount . The prices are already not that bad so it's a good deal. Every time I come here the staff are also super nice , not fake nice but I feel genuinely nice which always makes your day. Best of all I love the original name of this place :D</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is a newly opened establishment, which occupies where Super Burrito was.

I ordered a Large Bowl of Shrimp Tom Yum to go; this was my experience.

Atmosphere:  Very clean, typical Thai Buddhist interior; clutter free and peaceful.  The smell of fresh cut ginger, lemongrass, and other traditional Thai ingredients permeated the air and made ordering very difficult. I love that their kitchen in small in size; it guarantees your food is cooked to-order and is completely visible to the customer, which I believe builds trust (cleanliness &amp; food handling is top notch!). 

Service:  The owner kindly insisted on a glass of water with lime for myself, which she kept refilling until I left.  She chatted with me until my soup was ready for pick-up; she's so sweet.  Food was ready in about 8 minutes or so but I wasn't in a rush.

Food:  I'm actually finishing my huge portion of Shrimp Tom Yum; it's as close to authentic Thai as it gets, or at least since the last time I was in Thailand.  The Shrimp are generous in quantity, high quality (tail left on for flavor), and taste like the sea.  The broth is laced with pieces of ginger, lemongrass, tomatoes, garlic shoots, and quartered mushrooms.  The flavor is citrusy-seafood with a beautiful aftertaste of ginger...I can't get enough.

Price:  My Tom Yum was very affordable when compared to similar Thai Restaurant prices.  For how freshly it was prepared, the freshness and quality of the ingredients, and the service from the owner,  I would gladly come back.  Their menu was loaded full of traditional Thai and American-Thai favorites...can't wait to try more!

I got a delicious Thai Tea; on the house!  The owner is one of the sweetest women I've met; you have to love Thai people.

***I wish they had a website with a PDF menu option.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Great steaks and martini's, one of this earth's ultimate combinations.

Having not been to a Morton's in awhile and continuing our ongoing quest for steakhouses across America, we settled on this Morton's only about 50 paces from the Ritz-Carlton front door.

With your usual steakhouse decor of wood, subdued lighting and dark colors we found it inviting from the start. Nothing peaks the taste buds before a good steak like an icy cold vodka martini and this one did not disappoint. A generous pour shaken with just a twist of lemon is just what 007 had in mind.

Steak wise, the "Chicago" style 24 oz. bone in rib-eye was cooked to perfection. A nicely marbled piece of meat correctly charred on the outside leaving a nice flavorful juicy medium-rare on the inside. This paired with a very decent Whitehall Lane cab and sides of creamed spinach and split baked potato rounded out a satisfying meal.  

While "chains" can sometimes become diluted and uneven, it's refreshing to see that Morton's still live up to their name and reputation. This one is worthy of repeat visits.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I live close by so Peekaboo and I walk to this Walgreens a few times a week. There's a Redbox inside with our name on it. I like to take advantage of the clothing sales like the $1 multi-colored tank tops. Peekaboo likes the pet aisle, especially the doggie treats.

I haven't had any negative experiences here. The pharmacist has been helpful, they allow Peekaboo inside in a cart or my arms, and I always find what I need so I give this Walgreens 4 stars.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>A fun place to go for your birthday!  The wait staff is very friendly, easy-going, and kept checking on us.  We had the Garlic burger and the Teriyaki burger...very yummy....fries and pub fries are recommended. Nice to go for your birthday mug with unlimited beer/soda and the world's smallest ice cream sundae.  I'll definitely go every year.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Goon alert!

Food was once again, not terrible, but not what I ordered. (What's with this? Nothing on the menu is complicated, why can't you deliver what was ordered?)

However, when I tried to get the attention of my waiter I was accosted by a goon.

The guy tells me he is the manager, but he acted like a goon. Came up to the table, did not identify himself as being part of the establishment and growled "Waddya want?"  

He got angry and slammed away when I asked him who he was.

The waiter is a really nice guy and hampered by a kitchen that seems to never quite get it right. But where it is usually at least passable, the manager pushed them over to total failure.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place is awesome.  They are in a soft opening and there humidor is still getting broke in.  So there high end cigars are not in yet.

The atmosphere is relaxing and they have a oval office set up.

They have a good selection of beers that are unique.

Wine selection is great and priced right

The filet minon was perfect.

The staff is awesome.

Give them a try</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We arrived in Madison on Christmas and needed a place to have dinner - Denny's just wasn't going to cut it.  So we called The Casbah, which happened to be open, and were completely delighted with what we found.  Highlights:

-  Three stories - a basement with a cloth-shrouded den for each table, where you sit, surrounded by pillows and cross-legged like a sultan, a main story with club-style lighting adorning the walls and a very hip looking bar, and an upper level with your traditional fine-dining setup, white table cloths and a rustic feel.

- The fare - excellently done, but a little expensive.  We had "The Ultimate Grill" for two, in which everything was cooked to perfection, including the veggies!  We also had falafel &amp; tahini, which my Israeli accompaniment agreed was some of the finest we've tried in the States, tabouli, and a vegan lemon/lentil soup.  All were divine.

- Service - our waiter was friendly and earnest, and this was his first time out of the kitchen.  He was eager to share about the restaurant - the owner is a Palestinean and has been in Madison running the restaurant for over 30 years.

Definitely two thumbs up from us.  And thanks for being open on Christmas!  Love, the Jews</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Next to and connected to the City Stop gas station. Friendly staff and quick service for carry out. Staff was brief on the phone but friendly.
It is Domino's, so it is not the most fancy but the pizza looked and tasted fresh and delicious.</review:review_text>

It's simple lady's and Mary's..... if you have been to this Jenny's (thx Brian) at 2am on a Sat night I do not even need to continue. If you haven't....I recommend that you do. Nuff said</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>A friend and I wanted to try this place out after having lunch just down the way. The staff was very friendly and took the time to explain all their goodies in the case. They offered us a complimentary cake bite since it was our first visit. We both tried the salted caramel with peanut butter and my oh my was it delicious!
I ordered half a dozen cookies to take home and share with others. The chocolate coconut was one of my favorites and tastes similar to an Almond Joy. I'm a sucker for iced oatmeal cookies so that one didn't disappoint either. I personally favored the traditional icing on the sugar cookie vs the cream cheese but both were really tasty. I will definitely be going back especially next time I have a sweet tooth or need a sweet treat as a gift.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Came in the am for my free coffee on opening day!  I am a first timer and I can say I'm officially a fan.  Employees were all very friendly and I even took a selfie with them!  Love it!  They were all smiles.

Music was loud but that makes the environment fun.  I had the Cocomo on ice and it was very good.

This compared to Starbucks?  Both are equally good and close to price.  I like both.

Can't wait to try more!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>It had been a while since I've been to Cherry Blossom, so I didn't feel good about reviewing it until I tried it again recently.  It was just as good as I remembered.  The service is a tad slow and it is pretty smoky inside, so you run the risk of smelling like garlic and wok oil all day if you eat in.  But take out is always an option.  

I had a noodle soup with "mountain vegetables" and fatty udon noodles.  Mountain vegetables?  WTF?  The server didn't even know what the were but they tasted good.  

Two thumbs up.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I ate in Phuket Pavillion with some friends last year, and we all conceded that its service, food and atmosphere was flawless.  Phuket is an island off the coast of Thailand whose food, although characteristically Oriental, has its own unique style and flavour combinations.  The mood feels really relaxed and tranquil with soft lighting and gentle music, very fitting for the 'island' theme of the restaurant.  
The menu is extensive with an ecclectic range of curry, seafood, duck and stir fry dishes.  I went for the chicken penang with egg fried rice which came in a filling portion and a hot, creamy sauce.  We all thought the food was great and it seemed to take no time at all to arrive.  Further, it's moderately pirce, only costing about £15 per person which makes it a viable option for a tasty meal out.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>No. Just no. 

So small inside. When I sat down to eat my food in the corner I felt like I was in time out. Dead on a Friday night. 

Ordered the #2. Three different mini burritos. Great way to showcase three times in one visit that I don't like your food. We were told the salsas were spicy but they weren't. Chips were ok, a little salty. My burritos that had meat inside (pork and beef) were very dry. Not appetizing to me. My husband had a breakfast burrito and said they used fake eggs which is a pet peeve. 

We won't go back- Rubios is around the corner with $1.50 fish tacos on Tuesdays that are actually yummy. Sorry America. I don't like the food.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The steaks are SUPERB. Shared the 24oz porter house with my date. I do wish I would've asked for sauce on side. Excellent wine choices. I have to agree this is one of the best steak houses. Can't wait to go back.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>A weekend in PHX. I love to stay at the Biltmore, which is still full of really nice employees, despite reviews I've read on different boards.

I went to the fashion park before Jack could join me the next day. I looked at the menus of Sam's, Christopher's, and Steamers, and decided on Steamers  for lunch. I was very happy but wanted some wine and cheese post lunch.

So Christopher's was perfect. Now why only 3 stars? Well, maybe I should give 4. But: first, the ambiance/lighting was very off. It was an overcast day in PHX. But in Steamers it was still great. At Christopher's it was dingy with poor lighting. Secondly, whereas the bartender was very nice when present, she was seemingly too busy with other customers even at outside tables. And the place was NOT busy. 

The wine selection is excellent. The cheese selection is also excellent though I would have liked a little better recommendations.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Dump

I was scared for my life, You would be hard pressed to find a place more scary and sketchy in Las Vegas...

I had fun playing Bingo, but when we were leaving, I thought I was going to get shot as a police situation and manhunt was unfolding in the casino as i walk out the door I see two guys urinating in the bushes and one vomiting just steps from the police car... 

My first time playing bingo since I was a kid, if i have to deal with this scene no thanks...</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>First a truck and now a cafe?! Good things are happening with Buldogi's. Also, it needs to be said: this is run by some of the nicest people. They always take care of us and will have our business.

At the time of writing, it is in soft opening mode. Everything is half off. I think they close down this week around 2 or 3pm and only serve breakfast. I believe next week will be a lunch menu which includes more of their original menu from the Fort Apache location.

If you've been to Buldogi's before, you already will know their lunch menu. A mix of gourmet hot dogs with extravagant toppings, some bowls, burgers, and a hangover soup. You should look up the Fort Apache location to get the reviews on that menu. What's new is breakfast!

You've got an assortment of pancakes, waffles, french toast, and eggs. Sounds about right. There's even a Monte Cristo sandwich - which is French toast turned into a sandwich containing ham, turkey, eggs, and some jam. But then, the fusion starts.  The loco moco makes a comeback from the lunch menu, as well as the hangover soup. How about a mung bean pancake? Bulgogi and rice with eggs?

We took two of the new additions on the menu and one familiar hangover soup.

- Mung bean kimchi pancake. This is served with rice, two eggs, a side dipping sauce for the pancake, and a little cup of chopped cucumber and tomato. The pancake tastes great! Definitely something we haven't had before. It's dense, savory, and can be filled with either a few vegetable slices or pork belly. There is a weird lack of kimchi despite it being in the title. In terms of flavors and eating enjoyment, this is excellent. For value, it is not high (at normal price). To me, $11 is steep for the pancake's small size,  but I don't know if this is the final word. Especially for the area, it's going to be a tough sell. In thinking of points for increasing value - adding banchan!

- Monte Cristo French Toast. This is your ham and turkey sandwich, topped with eggs your way and made extra rich via French toasting the bread slices. The bread is cooked fluffy and flavorful, while the whole sandwich is generally served warm topped with (as requested) a liquid yolk. It is indulgent. Very, very indulgent and deliciously so. There is just no way you aren't going to love this. There is a side of jam with it but I didn't find it necessary - though HsiuTing Y. says that's how I'm supposed to eat it. Again, for $10 it is a little bit steep for just the sandwich. A few chips or fries on the side will really complete this.

- Hangover soup: we already love this soup. It's basically a chicken noodle soup from Korea with mung bean noodles (correct me if I'm wrong) and a spicy, flavorful broth. Some spinach leaves float around and enjoy the ambiance of the pulled chicken. If you haven't had it, you're missing out.

Service is in some ways the reverse of say, IHOP, where you eat and then bring your receipt to the register. You order/pay at the register and bring your number to the table. Your food will come out shortly! The new place is done up very nicely, especially for the area. Most things around here are just done on a tight budget.

They're still working on smoothing everything out so an update to this will surely come - but for the time being go get your preview of the new cafe!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Good chicken
Good waffle fries
Nice people but
Slow service (took 15 minutes to get food order inside on a rather slow day)

Plenty of little kids using pretty nice looking enclosed play area
Clean premises

On balance one of the better fast food options in the area</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>If you are into Spanish food then this is the place for you and when you do get here and if they offer all you can eat then them the up on it - you won't regret it.  For about £10 I got a group all you can eat here (that's £10 per head) and I have to say I've never eaten so much good food in one sitting.  The superlatives are quite frankly unnecessary because none of them will do it any justice.

The meal itself is likely to take a lot of time.  If you get a group meal the food will arrive in batches for you to help yourself to whatever you fancy and if you get all you can eat, these batches will keep coming until you decide that enough is enough.  At this point you'll have a conflict of interest, for you'll still want to eat this delicious food, but you'll also be very aware that you've probably eaten more than enough already.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>During the Superbowl many people who don't attend or host a party search for the perfect bar to enjoy the game. With the U.S. Presidential Election bearing down on the county, those of us who know, go to Nixon's to watch the results roll in, the biggest party in town. I was there in 2000, as the place was flooded with Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, Independents, etc. I was there to see Gore win, then to be withdrawn. I was there when Bush beat Kerry too. If you were there, Nixon's is what a sports bar is on game night, a big game night; it's the U.S. Presidential Election, the Superbowl of politics!

This November 4th, I won't be there though, as NIXON'S BAR HAS BEEN CLOSED. 

All the best to Phil, we'll miss your place!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>A few of my coworkers were raving about this place. They live outside of Tempe but work here, so when they heard a new location opened up by work we all had to go. I've only had it once but man was it good. They don't look like much but they are really filling and absolutely delicious. 

Definitely check it out! 

I haven't had the custard but I hear its phenomenal and if its half as good as the burgers and fries the frozen custard is going to be amazing.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Have you ever witnessed something so brilliant that the only thing  you could do was stop and take a moment to appreciate the scope of its awesomeness?

This happened after my first bite of the burger here at Wimpy's Paradise. The flavor! The texture! The toppings on my burger!

It has been a LONG time (maybe forever) that i've experienced so much flavor from a burger patty. If you are a fan of burgers you MUST try this place!

I will be coming back. If you drop in, tell Randy (the awesome owner) that the nice one sent you!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The smoothie could have been mixed a little bit better, unless you like sucking banana pieces up your straw. 

Teenage girls behind the counter were perky. Although I was the only patron in the store at the time, they asked my name when I placed my order. Odd, I thought, but cool. 

Very clean place with limited seating. Music was loud, though. Guess the teens were jammin' with Jamba.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We're moving house just now, and as a result we're both shattered all the time and don't feel like cooking.  So, when The Man suggested going out to dinner, I thought it was an amazing idea.  

He wanted somewhere within walking distance so we could go for a pint after, and I suggested Bells because a burger just sounded magic.

As the other reviewers have said, it's a complete and unassuming hole in the wall.  We walked in and the waitress asked us if we'd booked a table.  What?  On a Thursday?  For burgers?  We ended up sharing a table (no problem at all) with another non-booking couple.  

I immediately loved the menu when I saw that you could order your burger by 4oz, 6oz or 8oz.  I love food but often find that I'm not able to finish what is on my plate.  The 4oz was just perfect for me.  

Whe burgers arrived they were served on a fresh, toasted sesame bun, heaped with goodies - including pickles!  I've not seen pickles on a burger here before!  It was exciting.  
They weren't served with the fries in a separate little tin, they weren't served on a wooden slab, they were just normal.  No frills, no fancy dress, just goodness.
They also came with a huge tray of sauces so we could dress them exactly to our liking.  They were juicy, chargrilled bits of heaven.  Hands down the best burger I've had in Edinburgh.  Seriously.  

I will be coming back here every time I get a hankering.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We eat here a lot and I realized I haven't put a review in of this place. This is hands down one of the yummiest offerings at the Chinese Cultural Center. We've been to all the places in this complex, but for repeatable quality, good prices, and service, this is the best one. The servings are (IMO) three per entree. So when you go and you traditionally think one entree per person be warned! Expect to share. The hot and spicy soup is consistently one of the best in Phoenix. The Pork buns perfect, the best General Tao's I've been able to find, and large scallop and shrimp in the meals that feature them. I have not found a meal here that I regret ordering. The kitchen will work with you if you have special requests and they will not leave your drinks languishing. After approximately 20 visits, they have never gotten an order or a bill wrong.  The place doesn't have many people eating in it when I've gone usually Chinese people though. Once in awhile the place is quite full, but the best news is they are open EVERY DAY until 9:30. They are not upset when you arrive close to 9pm. Szechuan cooking is quite delightful here and I'll pick it over closer options any day of the week. I'm sorry I haven't Yelped them. They have been around for 10 years in this location and you should give them a try, especially if you are headed over to Ranch Market afterwards. I don't think you'll be disappointed.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I went to The Maltings a few times during my first year and I never really thought it was anything special.  A few of my friends, however, thought it was great and did the pub quiz every Wednesday night.  I played with them one night and we lost spectacularly but it was still fun.  The majority of the other competitors were at least twice our age and this is indicative of the customers which the pub attracts as a whole.  It isn't marketed to students and so you won't be getting any great deals from the bar or the latest beats coming from the jukebox.
The customers and the barstaff are all friendly, however, and they have a pool table which is in good condition.
The Maltings doesn't really fulfil my personal criteria for a pub but it's certainly a relaxing place to visit for a drink in the afternoon or evening.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I must admit I have only ever been in for a pint, but no real fault can I find. If I were to be over critical, the renovations to the bar area have made it uber cool inside which doesn't hold with the building...but this is being critical for critical's sake and it will not stop me going back for a thirst quencher. Their beer garden out the front is a winner...even in the snow!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>My wife and I visited The Bistro on a Thursday morning, June 26, around 9:00 am.  We came for the $1 coffee special and because we like local places, but we ended up ordering food and trying out this recently opened place.  

My wife had the bacon quiche was good but came out cold;  even the second time parts of it were barely warm.  It was a $5 special which was nicely priced for the portion.  I had the biscuits and gravy full order which consisted of two biscuits sliced in half and covered with sausage gravy all served in a large pasta bowl type dish. I enjoyed this dish.  The gravy seemed very real as opposed to out of a packet that I can make at home.  The gravy contained small sliced pieces of sausage which was fine with me but it was not the crumbled ground sausage that you often see.  It felt like a nice homemade dish of biscuits and gravy.  It was $6.

Besides the cold quiche and lack of any sort of "sorry" from the staff, my only other real complaint is the ordering process we experienced.  I realize that they had only opened about a week ago, but while we read their menu on a black chalkboard behind their counter and decided on our order at the counter, all four employees basically stood there watching us and waiting.  It just felt odd and uncomfortable with all four watching us. 

Overall it was a pleasant experience.  The atmosphere setting inside is nice with lots of windows and a quiet setting.  There is room for improvement but if they are anything like The Deli, then they will improve and it will be a nice spot.

I'd like to give it 3.5 stars because after my first visit I'm somewhere between "A-OK" and "I'm a fan".  Improving customer service and serving a quality product will serve them well here for much success in the future.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Loved it! From the decor, to the service, to the yummy cocktails Bound is probably one of my favorite "schmancy" bars in Vegas! Christina was our server and she was so completely awesome! She checked in on us at just the right times, helped us a ton with our drink selection and overall was just pretty great! 

Oh and I highly recommend the "Spicy Fifty"! I am sad we didn't get to try any of the espresso cocktails but will definitely have to try them next time.

Also the location of the bar is good for people watching. Haha! Oh how I love watching girls who obviously are not used to walking in heels stomp around like duckies. LOL!!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The window of Beets struck me because of its shiny display of different beers, lagers, and ales, plus it had a cool, catchy, wee name, so I decided to enter the premises. 

Let me start by saying I don't like beer, lager, or ale (what is the difference anyway? It was explained to me once, but my brain has decided to let go of the information), but I do enjoy perusing the different bottles and having a good gawk at the colourful labels depicting whatever brand or area of Scotland they're from, and wishing I did enjoy the taste of fizzy yeast. Uggh, I felt a bit ill writing the words fizzy yeast, not a good combination of words.

There's more to Beets than just beer though. It's also a delicatessen, so there's wine and bottles of fizz to be had, plus they offer a selection of yummy looking smoothies, paninis, sandwiches, coffees and teas, for sitting in or taking away, and have a small range of organic, specialist food on display.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I've eaten here twice now, and both were outstanding experiences. In particular I've enjoyed the strawberry lassi (though it does take them some time to make) and the appetizers, which are amazingly fresh. The entrees also deserve praise for their variety and interesting combination of ingredients... which, again, are amazingly fresh. In general my impression is that these folks really strive for the freshest ingredients possible with an enjoyable, slow-food delivery.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>==Gay Denny's Bingo==

[ ] Uncomfortable looking straight couple. What, you thought they called it "gay denny's" because it was so merry?

[ ] Half-drunk valley girl frantically slapping her boyfriend in the face. Whether it's to get him out of his drunken stupor or to arouse him, it doesn't seem to be working, babe.

[ ] Random cop harassing transexual/transvestite about "being lewd in public" or some other bullshit. Lewd? You're the one trying to put them handcuffs and take them to your car. Get over your lame self.

[ ] Waitress who has to wake up passed out patrons to bring them their food. 

[ ] Guy who leaves instructions for his friends to order for him so he can get his puke on. (Holy shit...Nathan?)

[ ] People fixing their makeup...in the men's restroom.

[ ] Glitter on the seats. And the table. Oh my god where is all this fucking glitter coming from?

[ ] Guy who, despite seeing that really hot girl making out with another girl, still thinks he's got a chance, and seems legitimately confused when girl is not interested in him. Just because her girlfriend's in the toilet doesn't mean she goes into "straight mode" for the next ten minutes. 

[ ] Dumb yelper taking notes for a future review. (Holy shit...me?)</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>As a vegetarian, very pleased with the range of options and quality of both food - flavoursome and filling portions - and the service - unobtrusive but prompt and professional. Good choice of a wide ranging menu for all types of diners. Never seen the place full - which it really deserves to be as the meals I have had there have all been excellent. Nice decoration, and decent, but discreet, lighting - no straining to see the menu or wonder what is on the plate! Good value for money. Highly recommend for couples, with a few friends or as a big group - plenty of seating as well as a seperate dining area is off the main dining room.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I don't make it to Grand all that often, so when I see the Paisley Violin it's usually on a First Friday when it's packed like a sardine can with cafe-goers mixing, mingling and watching a live band perform on stage.

Imagine my surprise on a recent Friday (not a First Friday) night for a show when there were only 5 or so people there.  Once the show wrapped up, it was back to kick ass deep 80s cuts (think Thompson Twins song from Sixteen Candles and Joe Jackson) from RadioNigel.com playing in the background.

The ambiance is a truly metro cafe - something many local coffeehouses are lacking. The feel inside is very bohemian chic with its moody lighting and eclectic look.  Random bric-a-brac abounds here - everything from fish tanks to a bird cage, for sale I think. It's more of a European caf / art gallery / live music venue than a coffeehouse.  Bathrooms are kind of rough around the edges - if you can hold it, you're better off.

They serve a variety of coffees and tea and light fare like sandwiches, salads - lots of veggie options, btw.

I had the mandarin spiced ice tea with a Venice Violin panini with dried Italian salami, provolone, veggies, pepperocini, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and Dijon mustard on a sourdough baguette. Nothing to write home about, but the food was pretty good.  

I really dug the vibe at Paisley Violin, I'll be back for sure - just not on a First Friday.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Heard about Magic Wok opening on Atwood so my husband and I decided to give them a try.  We were pleasantly surprised.  We started with Wonton Soup and Eggrolls.  The soup was delicious and there was plenty for both of us and enough for a couple of bowls at home.  The eggrolls were crispy and very flavorful.  Enjoyed it a lot.  I had the Orange Chicken, but was skeptical because it's usually a hot and spicy dish, but they told me they would do it without the heat.  It was amazing, perhaps the best Orange Chicken I've had anywhere.  The portions are large, so I brought enough home for four lunches.  My husband also thoroughly enjoyed his Lo Mein.  We can't wait to go back.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The food is very authentic.  The chef was professionally trained in a cooking school in Hong Kong.  You will not be disappointing, well unless you like standard fair, which this is not.   The seating is spartan but you get this sense that you are in a different city for a moment.  One of the best secret restaurants you will ever find.  This will not be a secret for long.  The Chef specializes in Dim Sum, unfortunately this location is too small for them to make very much.  I am very excited to see them get their own place and get things going.</review:review_text>

I loved sitting out front on the sidewalk and what I think is the owner seems to be hands on and super friendly.

    <review:review_text>The fact they have pudding as an option besides tapioca gets 5 stars from me.

You are probably wondering why would I give a business 5 stars for pudding???

If you are from the bay area you and enjoy pudding as an option for your drink besides tapioca and have lived out here long enough to know the struggle of not finding one decent tapioca having cafe that has pudding.  Until Now!!!!  
That only took 5 years for Arizona to catch up to California's status. 

Thank you jesus for this place I can live a little easier now until we move back!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I have not eaten at the Longhorn, from what other reviewers have stated it does seem like an incredible bargain.  Steak dinner for 5 bucks? Only in Vegas.

I stopped by the Longhorn Casino on a Friday night.  I heard from my friend Sara that there were some incredible drink deals to be had, dollar Coronas, dollar shots, etc.. I thought to myself, I can probably spend a lot of time here boozing for sure..

As we parked, Sara mentioned that my clothes would probably stink of cigarette smoke after going in the Longhorn.  I wasn't surprised, I tend to expect cigarette smoke anytime I'm in Vegas, it goes hand in hand.  

Upon entering the Longhorn, I was surprised at how small it was, and the fog like smokey haze fueled by chain-smoking gamblers.  I could tell this place was going to be cheap but dive as hell.

The bar area was small and absolutely packed with locals, and I noticed a TINY stage area behind the bar where Sara said there was a live one man band performer.  The bartender was quick with the drinks, poured generously with the tequila shots and gave us some sass for being from Novato.

We wandered out of the crowded bar area with our drinks and boozed by the slot machines.  One of the locals, who appeared to be wasted (at 8:00pm) came over to us and started exercising her charms on Sara.  

Regardless of how smokey and crowded it was, it was a totally fun experience.  Lots of interesting characters at this place for sure.  And just in general I think local casinos are more interesting places to visit than some of the casinos on the strip.

Eventually we felt the need to leave, smoke was too intense.  But I encourage anyone in the area to go and get the "Vegas Experience".</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Been to Five Guys a few different times. The best one was in Wisconsin by my Dad's house. Maybe it was just getting to have lunch with him that made it so special.

This is another one of those burger chain places where you can have your order tailored to the way you want. Wow ... what a concept!

Inside has your basic counter service with a large amount of seating around small tables and chairs. The decorations are simple and they seem proud about who they are and what they do. You will always see several "Best of ____" signs plastered all over the walls.

Usually order one of the Burgers and a Dog. The Fries are so big that you can split them with a friend or loved one. The orders will promptly arrive in a large greasy brown bag. Normally tear it open and spread it all over the table. Kinda like camping?

Service is always friendly and the food is OK. This is probably not my favorite establishment for burgers or dogs. Everything is pretty expensive considering the type cuisine. Fifteen bucks for a Little Cheese Burger, a Little Fries and a Hot Dog is COO COO CRAZY!

Consider spending a little extra money for a high quality Gourmet Burger somewhere else. There are plenty of tasty places all around this area. Unless you just can't resist the all you can eat Peanut gimmick. PEANUT ALERT!

    <review:review_text>We are a serious BBQ loving family. We were really looking forward to having a great BBQ restaurant in the West Valley. We finally have one! This place was terrific. We tried the brisket, turkey, chicken, ribs, sausage, and several of the sides. Everything was perfect. We only wished they had corn bread and mac-n-cheese on the menu. Guess you can't have everything. Service was great and fast even though the place was packed and the line out the door. Would recommend this place to anyone that wants good Texas BBQ.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Vienna Beef FTW! Any hot dog place that proudly serves Vienna Beef is a hot dog place for me. After a lesson on the history of Vienna Beef from the boyfriend's iPhone, we were in the mood for some good Chicago-style hot dogs and since we were in the area (on the way back from a Cubs/White Sox spring training game), we stopped in. I used to live in this area and had been here several times when it was under a different name and it's still as delicious. It seems to me that they're still using the same good products. 

We both got the "hot dog and fries basket" which was just as it sounds. Good hot dog, served with all the fixin's (or however you request): mustard, onions, relish, tomatoes, cucumber salt, and sport peppers. Nom. 

Lots of sports memorabilia on the walls- great for looking around while you wait for you food to be cooked fresh to order.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>So this is a Vegas country dive bar that has karaoke.  It is 4 miles down Boulder Highway from downtown -  bar names don't get much more on point than that eh?  (East Vegas Wasteland Bar was considered too honest)

Anyway this place is the most authentic Texas Roadhouse style saloon that I've seen in Vegas, not that I've really been looking.  The karaoke is DJ'd by a man with a HANDLEBAR MUSTACHE who looks like a real cowboy.  There is a shotgun behind the counter next to the register.  I noted three cowboy hats.

They have an extensive selection of cheap beers and liquors, and enough whiskey to get a donkey drunk.  I went with the $3 (!?) draft pint of Amberbock, a domestic with a darker color and more flavor than most.  The karaoke was not as awful as I had feared, although there was a lot of Garth Brooks in the hizzy, peeps.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This coffee shop is offering two $1.99 breakfast breakfast specials and we tried both.  Ms. Westie chose the 2 eggs (easy over), toast, bacon and hash browns while I feasted on 2 pancakes and bacon.  Both were very well executed and service was attentive. ($6.29)

A few days later I requested a comp from the Slot Shift Supervisor and received one for  $25.  Ms. Westie and I each ordered OJ, an avocado omelet and bacon. The omelets were satisfactory, but nothing to write home about.  The bill was an amazing $22.78.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I really like Java Detours drinks. Especially the Oreo Latte, yum!Employees are always very friendly. The one thing that disappointed me is that they had a punch card for customers (buy 10 drinks get one free) and I devotedly brought it with me everytime I went there to get it punched. I was one punch away from a free drink when I handed my punch card over to the employee and she said sorry they discontinued them. I was very disappointed. I understand if they discontinued the punch card concept, but at least honor the ones that are still in circulation!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Discreet, Intimate, and Las Vegas
Is this a lounge, nightclub, or the refractory period after a successful night in Las Vegas?

Speakeasy - It is not as easy as it sounds.  If you are unfamiliar with the prohibition era you need to know Las Vegas embodies speakeasies and Holly Madison has brought it back with a modern twist.  Like all speakeasies discretion is key.  Inconspicuously tucked in the corner the typical tourist may literally walk past this place because it is seemingly a small bar yet it is camouflaging the experiences within.  This was a soft opening.  With next to no advertisement the onus is on you.  My wife knew where to go.  

You'll see a car, but not the usual car surrounded by slot machines begging to be won. Next to it a well dressed, well groomed man to screen wanderers for the 21+ limit.  I casually struck up conversation and inserted the name of the bar like a secret pass-phrase.  The bouncer knew what I meant and told us the unique password that would grant my spouse and I access.  Tonight was "Cold War".  The secrecy and use of codes words threw me back in time to the age of illegal pleasures (and alcohol was illegal).  I moved toward the bar and then used this pass-phrase in a sentence.  "I'm glad the cold war is over," and, reminiscent of a spy film, the secondary bouncer agreed in kind, allowing access to the bar.

When we finished our beverage we progressed to a wonderfully hidden passageway to enter 1923: Bourbon &amp; Burlesque.  Tonight was the second night of operation, the "soft opening."  Everything was clean and crisp, and begged to be toured.  There is the cigar room with paintings on the wall demanding the masculine man to breathe in its offerings.  We found our seats on the ground level in front of the main "stage."  The bar may be appear small, but I prefer to say intimate.  You can mix and mingle with like minded persons, but I relaxed with my wife.

The bar is fairly priced for the strip.  

Now, to get to my review:  
Many of the men, from the bouncer outside to the band members inside wore the typical fedora or Newboy hat.  There were other hats of that era why not try them out?  See Cloche hat for women, or the Bowler, Homburg and Straw Boater for men. And the Cocktail servers looked like they came off their shift from dancing on the card tables.  Change their attire please.  You can still be sexy.  Speaking of, the cocktail waitresses were no where near the version of 1920s beauty.  See Christina Hendricks in Mad Men.  

I was not a fan of the DJ playing bass bumping music.  Was I in a speakeasy or an attempt at being another club?  Refer to The Great Gatsby and encourage use of the dance floor.  However, as the night progressed things changed from a club to speakeasy with a live band playing off to the side.  The band played mixed songs, more instrumentals of modern music which was perfect for me.  The volume was a bit too loud for my taste, it seemed I was yelling at my wife sitting right next to me.  Allow patrons to have an even conversation about their Vegas conquest without feeling like shouting.  

The Bar and service.  Service was great or perhaps they were overstaffed?  Cause of the soft open.  The first bar you see is the mixology bar, where they can work their magic conjuring any drink you desire.  I went to the secondary bar.  I was able to strike a conversation with the bartender, as though we already knew each other.  We shared a laugh and I enjoyed whiskey.  Oh, no ice please, I prefer whiskey stones.

Then there is the performances.  This makes everything worth it.  Remember how I said this was intimate? Well, if you don't have a good seat, then good luck. The layout is too flat, practically one leveled.  But we were lucky. 
The burlesque performances are supported by Holly Madison aka "The Girl Next Door" and she did not fail to put on a show.  Being so close quartered, performers secretly go on stage and the only queue is the change in music, which calmly pulls your attention to the show.  I don't think you'll find a more sultry respectable performance like this anywhere on the strip (and industrial is NOT the strip).  
The piano-singer interaction made me feel I was the only one tucked away in the forbidden speakeasy being serenaded.  One of the singers, even came down to the crowd to entertain us with her vocals.  SKYE .. With an "E" for EVERYTHING.  This was not all at once but spread throughout the night; however, I would prefer that someone sing between shows to add to the background band.

My wife and I went on the second night of their soft opening, so things may have changed.  So, why 5 stars?  Even though I have a few critiques I see all its potential.  Our hands on experience and the atmosphere made this local couple look forward to coming back.  Besides, you may run into a celebrity or two.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>At this point, Crandall's is only a bookmark for me.  However, I did stop by only to discover yet another Middleton restaurant closed on Sunday.  Middleton I love your town, but you're killing me with all the restaurants closed on Sundays and Mondays.  In addition, the first two restaurants I drove to were recently CLOSED for good.  

I'm hoping to try Crandall's out sometime, but it will be a challenge since I'm usually in town on Sunday.  Eitherway, I understand the quality of your food is great and your fish fry is the best in the Madison area. The drive thru and patio are also nice features.  

We'll have to rely on other Yelpers to offer a more accurate rating.  I gave the A-OK 3 star rating since a rating is required.  Check out my pics.  You can also find a PDF menu on their website.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Hardee's in Madison is kind of a tradition for my family whenever we drive through town.  We do not have a Hardee's where we live so it is kind of a treat for us.  Simply put, the food is better than Mc Donalds and the deals are comparable.  The service is not quite as quick but your food is fresher when you get it.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Pizza heaven first caught my eye at it's original location, on the corner of Highland and 7th st.  The building was old, fairly cramped and didn't have much to offer in aesthetic. However, as I could very nearly hit it with a baseball from my condo, I had to at least give it a shot.

 I was not disappointed. 

The pizza, wings, pasta and sandwiches are all excellent, and every employee I have encountered has been very friendly. The restaurant has now moved up 7th street to a new location that is more representative of the quality of the food and service. A great place to grab a quick slice for lunch, or a full pie and a beer (or six) in the evenings. A flyer in the restaurant claims they have live music on the weekends, although I haven't yet witnessed this.  

Overall, great quality and variety. Pepperoni, mushroom, pepperocini on wheat crust FTW!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Nice place. Everything looks clean and fresh. A little hard to fine but it is sandwiched between Jimmy John's and five guys burgers. A little bit of a wait but worth it for healthy options. 
The fresh juices and bowls are priced reasonably.
Be sure to ask for 'light ice' they got a little heavy handed with it on the drinks I ordered.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Southern Rail is on the right track but at the time of this review is brand new and possibly still working things out. 

The servers seemed well polished and the cocktails we tried were tasty and strong.

We shared a small plate of House Smoked Trout with Pea Cakes and Tomato Jam. I thought this dish was put together well and was my favorite of the plates I tried. The Trout was smoked nicely and wasn't too much smoke. The Pea Cakes reminded me of Falafels but green with fresh peas bursting out and the Tomato Jam wasn't just sweet Tomatoes it had a little Kick to it. They all harmonized nicely together.

The starter plate of Cauliflower Casserole was for my taste (maybe not yours) was overly generous with cheese and seemed to lack the onion cream that was in the description. For me this plate was too heavy and I think someone just slipped with the cheese that wasn't in the description of this dish. Possibly an opening hiccup.

 I need to reveal a full disclosure that I am sensitive about smoked foods and only care for a mild smoke taste that might differ from you.

I tried the Chicken and Biscuit Dumplings. I received a bowl of many nicely made cheesy dumplings in a very smoky dark sauce with 2-maybe 3 ounces of nicely prepared dark meat chicken a few very thin shaves of Local McClendon Carrots, Chunks of Mushrooms and some fresh pea tendrils. I was slightly disappointed for a few reasons. As good as the Biscuit Dumplings were and they were. This dish for me was too much Dumplings and should have been called Biscuit Dumplings with Chicken. I could only eat maybe one and a half and had I think three maybe three more dumplings. In the description of the dish was the mention of McClendon Carrots. I was expecting carrots to have a co-staring role and not to be  just a few shaves for color.  For my taste the sauce was WAY too smoky but might be great to other people who like smoky food. 

My husband tried the Smoked Chicken and Andouile Sausage Gumbo. He said it was good. He eats Authentic Gumbo whenever he is in New Orleans and said the one at Southern Rail was good but thinner than other Gumbos he tried and also more smoky than others he tried but still good to him.

3.5 stars On the right track but a LOT of Smoke a little steam.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I've been coming here for YEARS and just thought to review it?  WTF is wrong with me???????????????????????
THIS is Mexican seafood.  I've been to other places and nothing compares!  I take a book, sit in back and people watch while creaming my "Make Me Yelp" panties as I eat my culichi.  It's D I V I N E!  Eat the shrimp with a fork but you sure as Hell better use a spoon to destroy the rest of the bowl and leave it clean!
Everything is fresh and the wait staff is loaded with recommendations.  Ask, and ye shall find. 
The snapper Veracruz is so good I often order 2 and take one home.  
The decor is fun - aquatic scenes that won't make you feel guilty for eating the seafood in front of you.  
At Xmas they had a Santa at the door!  The people here a super-friendly!  
They have their own parking lot.  You know it's a good place when yours isn't the fanciest car in the parking lot.  All kinds come here, despite the neighborhood not being the nicest in DoPho.  You can't miss it - even though I do pass it every time!  I think I'm too excited thinking of the shrimp culichi and my mouth is watering so much that I always manage to say "Crap, passed it again!"
Go.  Just go to this place.  You won't be disappointed.  I swear.  And, you won't break the bank.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The picutes look tastier than the food actually is. The first time I went was the mini tacos. yuck . i left hungry. I'm all about mexican food but they had more onions in there than meat. maybe it was just my tacos that were gross. The carnitas tacos however were so good. I'd order those again. definitely. the chips and salsa were so gross.. my bf and I ALWAYS finish the basket.. NOT this time. we left the whole basket there. stale ass chips w/ watered down salsa. Yet I will say this place is always busy.  The 2nd time I went I was hung over and craving menudo. I got it to go and they packed it nicely with red pepper flakes, oregeno and it was good but not great. extremely oily, more than most menudos i've had lately. I wouldnt order it again. Knowing how many calories I'm consuming there... I'd rather go nxt door and eat @ Weinerschnitzel. :)</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I drove past Scott's while looking for a place to purchase propane... Go figure.  Decided to stop in and sample their sweet treats. 

Cookies: definitely crunchy. I'm not a fan of a crunchy cookie - I prefer a chewier cookie, so Scott's cookies weren't quite what I had hoped they would be.

I decided to try a doughnut and selected a cream-filled chocolate iced doughnut. It was decent, but as someone else mentioned, about what you'd expect to find at a decent grocery store.

All things considered, I would probably go back for another doughnut, but I'd pass on the cookies. If you like a crunchy cookie, give 'em a try.

Oh; inside? Nice. Open, bright, clean, and the staff was very friendly.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Enjoyed a fabulous Italian dinner. Our Server Eugene, formerly from Roka Akor, as always phenomenal.  Knew the menu and specials, recommendations were excellent choices!! Very professional. When you make a reservation or walk in request Eugene's Station you will not be sorry. The Manager and Hostess of this new restaurant were very visible and made inquiry as to the service and food, refilling our waters and beverage.  The pesto, served with the great assorted bread basket is superb!! This is a true winner.  Eating outside you see the beautiful Fountain.
ENJOY!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Two things you need to know off the bat.  First, 21 and above only; no problem.  Second, SMOKE SMOKE SMOKE everywhere; gross.  Went to the opening last night, and it was packed and loud, but a good vibe and crowd.  There was a band playing, but after talking with one of the owners that won't be an "everyday" thing, at least not for now.  Even though it was busy, the servers were quick and prompt and very very friendly and upbeat.  The decor is warmer and more inviting than when this place was Agave, with a lot of lounge chairs and tables replacing the old table booths.  The patio is still there and will be a welcome place to hangout in the warmer weather.  There is also a game room area, with video bowling, golfing, pool table, etc.  And, the "jukebox" is pretty cool, with the ability to sync to your iPhone and music playlists.  And of course plenty of  TVs throughout to catch your fave sporting event.

This morning we decided to try out breakfast, since we were running errands in the area.  We sat in the main bar area, and my first impression was "I don't want to eat in a place that all I can smell is cigarette smoke."  It's just not appealing.  It didn't seem so smokey the night before, but this morning was a different story.  The menu looks good, and they serve breakfast 24/7.  My husband had the build your own breakfast burrito (sausage, spinach, tomato and cheese), and they forgot the sausage.  I had the patty melt and it was "meh".  Not great.  Not horrible.  I ordered a bloody mary...let's just say it needs work.  Like, a lot of work.  I don't know what I had, but it was no where close to a bloody mary, lacking in taste and "zip."  Our waitress seemed nervous, and I'll chalk it up to the place only being open for 2 days.  But first impression, she had the personality of a log.  On a side note, the manager came over and introduced herself and was very welcoming, perky and nice.  Like I said, I'll chalk it up to nerves and the newness of it all.

This place has the potential to be a great locals hangout, and the owners are experienced restauranteurs/tavern/grill operators.  We'll give it a month to work out the kinks and go back and give it another go.  However, it'll have to be on the patio to avoid as much smoke as possible (if I want smoke with my food and drink, I'll go the casino across the street, or to the Irish bar at Boca Park; point is, Summerlin doesn't need another smokey bar/grill).  And, maybe I'll hand the bartender a good bloody mary recipe while I'm at it.

I do hope this place does well either way.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>My mother is a member here and she wanted to come for a family dinner over the holidays.  They have completely remodeled this country club which was long overdue and it is so gorgeous now.   It is hard to put into words the transformation this place has undergone.  It does not look anything like it used to except for maybe the golf course and the parking lot.  Our server was young and was probably used to going through the motions of serving tables, but we were there to enjoy ourselves and have drinks and conversation... when we clued him into our intentions he was fine with that and very accommodating.  There was one minor incident where he spilled my cosmopolitan on my sisters fiance, but he handled it like a champ:).  We actually felt really bad for him because we know that is a servers worst nightmare... he was lucky that he did that to our table and not another club member... somehow i don't think they would have been as nice as we were.  Our food was very good and our server was a great guy too!  We had a great time at the Arizona Country Club.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I went to the new burger joint Back Room Burgers at the Palms just for fun.  I always check out new restaurants when I can.  I had the Barry Burger that was simple delicious.  The bun fell apart and the waiter told his boss.  Next thing I know she showed up and we chatted awhile and she had taken my burger off the ticket.  WOW was that a surprise.  I also tried the blue cheese bacon fries.  OMG that were delicious.  I enjoyed the atmosphere and the music ( my generation)  enjoyed the great conversations with the staff.  Very friendly place.   I will be back and bring some friends.  I asked for a menu to take to work and an opportunity to do a review.  Overall had a great experience.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>My favorite place for fast food in Madison - I have both locations in my cell phone for quicker pickup.

    <review:review_text>Went in to pick up a menu........ No prices on it....no location addresses or phone number on it.  No prices on their website as well. Pease dont tell me prices fluctuate 
From town to town?????

UPDATE: 6/6/14. Just ate at Americas and they finally have menus with prices.
I had the carne asada burrito and my girlfriend had the taco trio.
The fruit on the tacos was a good addition but overall.....just ok.
The tortillas are the same as i buy from the supermarket and their guacamole.....well...it was bright neon green and smooth like soft  serve icecream.
Not sure if its made there or a buy out product. The latter i believe.
I believe the tortillas, chips and guac are all buy out products.
Once again.....ok at best</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I agree with Sean, as a Chicago native every good 'street food' type joint has the hot dog statue outside and the sports posters and stuff lining the walls.
Today saw me ordering a gyro and I really would not recommend this as a gyro place.  The pita was good enough, but the meat was weird-dry and VERY lemony...tzatziki would hold it's own I suppose but the meat totally took away from the experience.  Seven bucks for a gyro and small pop.  Take that for what it's worth..........
I've eaten lunch here previously and I thought the beef sandwiches were okay, not great by any means but I'd order a beef sandwich way before the gyros should I lose my mind and patronize this establishment again.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Ate there once, and short of being annoyed by all the silly, wannabe island retreat crap, the food was average, overpriced, and it was the middle of Wisconsin winter, so who wants to be reminded that it's 3 freaking degrees outside.  Actually, the biggest problem I had with this place was the extravagant price for the bland food.  Much better burgers and sandwiches in Madison for a much more reasonable price.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>great food--not the same old, same old stuff.
donna was a great server and we enjoyed her explanations of the food.
it was just a tad pricey by about 20% but it was good. my wife and i liked the fact that the portions were not overwhelming and we could eat and be full without getting a carry out bag. 
we saw a coyote standing near the tee about 20 yards away and also a rabbit down on the fairway.
this place is just 2 and one half miles west of maricopa on highway 238 and is called grille 109. it is newly remodeled and very nice and comfortable. we loved it!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is really what you would call an old mans pub (though to me old counts as over 30, so don't be offended by this statement), but it's friendly enough and doesn't make you feel out of place.

On Friday and Saturday nights you get karaoke here and that's been the reason for my visits, because you get a decent amount of numbers in without the same amount of wait time you get elsewhere.

All round it's a decent enough pub, but I still feel a bit too young to truly feel at home here - maybe when I'm older though.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We were there for the soft opening tonight and even then, best pizza in QC is Buddyz! Its a Chicago style restaurant (though the quality does not drop off at all with their thin crust) so we had the deep dish BBQ chicken -- WOW! Excellent ingredients. Great taste. Best part was the crust -- crispy and not a hint of sogginess at all! The 10' was enough for my wife &amp; me, and there are even 2 slices leftover for lunch tomorrow. We also enjoyed the boneless wings, and our friend shared his onion rings, which were phenomenal! I'd absolutely recommend this place. Well worth the drive!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I'm a not infrequent visitor to the bar upstairs, so I was really pleased to be so well served in their smart bistro restaurant, downstairs. The menu is very well written and the quality of the cooking matched the description.

Overall, we said: "I was delighted with A Room in the West End. It almost goes without saying that the company played a huge part in that sense of delight, but the food, particularly that rabbit main course, played a significant part, too. It's a smart place with a lot of charm, serving dishes to a much higher quality than it's sister restaurant in Dundas Street. I'd happily recommend that you pay it a visit."</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>If you understand the differences between absolute and program music and can deliver a dissertation on Baroque, Classical, and Renaissance styles then good for you. Drop me an email because some of it is completely over my head and skip this review because it's not for you. 

If your looking for something different, a brief respite to rip you away from the grind and let your mind wander formlessly amid the music then check out the symphony. Despite popular belief there is no formal dress code however you might find a favorable response from your fellow patrons if you wear a shirt and shoes after all this is the symphony not the South. Though some people wear jeans you may feel more comfortable in a pair of slacks or casual business attire but ultimately who cares you paid for a ticket just like everyone else. Largely, the only complaint I can muster are the somewhat cramped seats in Phoenix Symphony Hall. Intermissions usually offer a coffee and cocktail bars. Also make sure and arrive slightly early, while they might not care about how you're dressed, etc. I promise you they absolutely will not let you to the hall after the doors close, you will be stuck in the lobby until the intermission.
  
Downtown Phoenix and the other symphony venues also offer a variety of wonderful places to dine before or after the performance. The Phoenix Symphony website www.phoenixsymphony.org offers additional information, performance calendars, and ticket sales. Unplug and give it a try.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I don't think it was that long ago that I went with my BFF to nosh on fine deli foods. He ordered a bacon cheeseburger with peanut butter without the bun (crazy diet) and I ordered something with traditional flare. Well, yesterday  I was jonesing a bacon cheeseburger with peanut butter but this place has closed. Sigh. The times I came here were great. I loved the menu. I loved the bitchy waitresses. I loved the tacky seating. This was a sweet-ass place. And now it's closed. Shucks. How long was Katz here, serving up deli delectables to the masses (and high school students) for all those years. Cripes. Good bye, Katz. I didn't grow up with you, but I did grow bigger with you. And you'll be missed.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>After 9 on a Monday night, even during The Festival, is probably not the time to see this place at its best but then on the otherhand its hardly likely to be high class dining at the best of times, as I've yet to experience one of its kind that's more than functional.


 A good and wide selection of starters, main courses &amp; desserts seem to be available although at the time of night I visited they're understandably not all replenished continuously. A small selection of sushi was also evident although neither myself or my companion sampled this.


 All in all then on a par with Jimmy Chung's &amp; the others of its ilk - a means to an end.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I came out to West Wing for their grand opening  a couple weekends ago.

This place is going to be amazing.

The seating area is open and spacious. 

The staff was extremely friendly.

They have a good cigar selection, and that was even before the second humidor was ready!  

The food is good...I'm not sure why they serve their filet sliced, but it still tastes great. 

Also, the Malbec wine is a winner.  

I will definitely be back.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place has its ups and downs. For a chain the burgers are generally very good, and the steak fries are tasty with the house seasoned salt. If I could I would always get a burger to go, though, as the dining room is full of loud little kids and tacky crap hanging all over the walls.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place definitely has the best name out of all the surprisingly large number of pubs on this tiny street, but I'd only go here if I were ordering food.

It's main drawback is the lack of beer garden. We get hardly any sunny days in Edinburgh as it is, so on those rare occasions I like to be able to make the most of them and get sunburnt in a beer garden. No can do here.

For that reason I tend to drink next door in the Peartree, but then that brings me back to the original dilemma... they don't do food. The Blind Poet, on the other hand, does awesome food. And it's reasonably priced too. The only bad thing about it is that it's so popular with uni students at lunchtimes that you'll almost never find somewhere to sit, and when you do you'll have to wait a fair while before you get your food. 

So, the Peartree and the Blind Poet think they have come up with a great compromise: you can order and pay for your food in the Blind Poet, but eat it next door in the Peartree. The only problem with this is it's a) a massive hassle, and b) the Blind Poet is so nice inside you won't really want to eat your food next door.

Hopefully they'll merge the two one day...</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This creamery serves the most DELICIOUS, DELECTABLE, homemade ice-cream made with the cream and milk from their own cows, with a wonderful selection of about 15 flavors or so.  The salted caramel flavor was highly recommended by the locals there and was delish.  But why not sample them yourself - the blueberry cheesecake flavor and banana-chocolate were also so good I had to try all three flavors.  This is true ice-cream, rich and creamy.  You won't need so much to be satisfied.  I HIGHLY recommend this ice-cream!!!  I make my own ice-cream and also travel a lot and enjoy trying real ice-cream everywhere, so I am a bit spoiled...this ice-cream exceeded even my expectations!!!

The creamery also offers a wide selection of milk, chocolate milk, cheeses, and other dairy products, and other local foods.

P.S.  They have adorable baby goats and a baby cow outside that love to eat the dandelion greens if you want to feed them.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Sadly enough, this once hookah bar is now only a restaurant/bar due to Madison's smoking ban.  One of Casbah's best kept secrets is the fact that they have half-price appetizers during happy hour (until 6:00) M-F.  My girlfriends and I just ate here Friday night, sneaking in at 5:45 and eating at the bar because the only two tables downstairs were full.  The food was delicious and because it was so cheap, we ordered 5 appetizers...for a total of $16.50!!!!!!  Everything was served with warm pitas and I would highly recommend the Dolmadakia Yalantzi, which is grape leaves rolled with a filling of seasoned rice, chopped fresh tomatoes, and spices.  Delicious!  Also, if you are in them mood for a real meal...the prices range from $12-20 with good vegetarian options.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Bachi does breakfast (and lunch)! Start the Yelp hype machine because this place is good and it's only a matter of time before there's a line out the door. Beignets were airy and delicious but the star was the house made strawberry guava jelly. The almond brioche french toast was amazing, especially with almond butter and coconut syrup.

They're open for breakfast and lunch only.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Great find!  It's a new hole-in-the-wall mom &amp; pop noodle shop where the owner, Vid (very friendly guy and great cook), says it's mostly Hong Kong style soup/noodles, but there were other things on the menu.  Very clean with modern decor...both table and counter seating.  5-stars for great food each visit, and very reasonably priced.  One of my new favorite places!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Went here early on Sunday. Not busy at all. I also came here because they accept cards inside and the one on Pecos and desert inn doesn't. Weird right! Yeah any ways the play equipment is kinda boring but new and clean so always a plus!

Also the food was cheaper at this one. Hmmmm!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Sassy Cow opened just as I was moving away from the US and I've driven past it every time I came home to see my family since, but hadn't stopped it. I remedied this over Christmastime. 

The ice cream. Oh, the ice cream! Delicious. Right up there with Babcock Hall ice cream. Fresh, creamy creamy creamy, and just tasty!  I tried the ginger pear and the salted caramel. My dad stands by the amazingness of the strawberry, but I haven't tried it (yet). I also have had their milk and it's lovely, fresh milk.

Very friendly staff and the prices, while a little high for ice cream, are fully in line for this being an independent family-owned and operated business. I love the idea of a farm-based shop and will keep Sassy Cow on my list of must-visit places whenever I come home :)</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I've come in for both lunch and dinner a few times and have always enjoyed it. The tables are spaced enough for privacy and the decor is understated.

Service-wise, a little slow at times. Don't get mad; it's nothing against you.

Regarding food; yum. Love their falafel, as an appetizer, sandwich, or main dish. Moist and flavorful. 

They always present you with a complimentary cup of tea, too. I love tea.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Mr. Hottie and I ventured over here today to check it out. Talk about a diet deviation!  I was a little nervous to disappoint him as he's from Illinois and Great Dane's claims to serve Chicago Style Dogs. I took a deep breath and went inside.

Great Dane's is an older building that could be designated as a charming little hole in the wall. The inside is covered with pictures of dogs, those you eat and those you pet. 

We went to the counter to order and were greeted warmly. The girl behind the counter was friendly and explained what the various types of dogs were. Mr. Hottie chose 2 Chicago Style dogs (Great Danes) and I chose the Hound Dog (a larger hot dog) with cheese, chili and sauerkraut (hey... don't knock it until you try it). All the dogs come with your choice of fries or coleslaw.

We grabbed a small table and waited for our order. It wasn't long before our food was brought to our table. My hot dog was delicious. The meat was all Vienna Beef and it wasn't at all greasy or mushy. My hot dog was actually "meaty" if you will. Mr. Hottie's dogs were good! (Sigh of relief). He said the same thing about his dog. A few observations he had was that he wished that they added more Sports peppers on the dog. It only came with one on each dog. He also wished for more tomato. The dogs automatically came with sauerkraut which, I learned, is not usually on a traditional Chicago dog unless you ask for it. 

Overall, we liked Great Dane's. It's a little old gem and I'm sure we'll visit it again whenever we're feeling naughty and craving wieners! HOT DOGS YOU PERVS! Go check it out. You'll see what I mean.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I've gotta say, dominoes has stepped up Their game. Their still no Grimaldi's or Metro but for the price you can't beat it. They use better ingredients and the staff is friendly. I ordered online this evening and it was really simple. I like that u can 'track' your pizza and see what's going on with your order. From now on when we order pizza it's only Dominoe's or Rosatie's :)</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Papa John's is great pizza! Unfortunately, I never had the opportunity to get it delivered. After calling the store I was informed the front door of my residence was past the delivery boundary. My back door is adjacent to the street they deliver to. Didn't matter to the phone operator and never even considered finding a way to make it work. 

The employee's response, "the boundary has to be set somewhere" works in theory unfortunately this customer lives in reality. Really disappointed with the service being offered. 

I understand there are policies but being 20 feet past an arbitrary boundary is absurd. Thanks Papa!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>A new place that just opened today...another GREAT addition to all the fun, cool places to eat downtown!! 

Owned and operated by 2 guys who say they've been in the fine dining world of F&amp;B here in Vegas for awhile...decided to take everything they learned, and open up a unique twist on making sandwiches.

Everything is done "monte cristo" style(or not)...dipped in egg batter and fried. Menu items go from $3 up to $9. I really loved the sandwich with foie and crisp chicken skin! My GF thought her spanish sandwich was delicious, with just the right amount of heat! Then we split the nutella and marshmallow sandwich as dessert. 

Since both the guys were there making and serving food, the service was top notch! They said they plan on one of them being there all the time. Open lunch and dinner, including late night. Both are really interesting to talk to...whether it's about the restaurant business here in Vegas...or the about how the downtown is improving(both of them live in the neighborhood).

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This isn't normally the type of restaurant we'd go to, but they were offering Restaurant.com girft certificates, so we gave them a shot. I reviewed the menu prior to going and knew what to expect -- overpriced American food. But, with the cert. it ended up being a pretty reasonably priced meal for three (including drinks and a dessert). The food actually wasn't bad -- everything was fresh and warm. 

The service was great! Everyone was super friendly and our waitress was very nice and informative. When I realized she'd overcharged on something, she corrected it without the least bit of irritation. 

Beer prices were okay, wine was pretty high (didn't even get into mixed). All in all, I would say their food isn't bad, but you can get much better for much less a few blocks away. If it's convenient for you, it's really not the worst you could do. With a coupon, it comes out comparable to other places that don't have the convenience of a hotel.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>If you want to swing, lindy hop or balboa, the Saturday Night Stomp is the place to be. 
The adventure starts with the location. Just east of Fremont East, you get away from the neon and into the gritty old Vegas. The Knights of Columbus Hall isn't recognizable from the street: You have to look for the symbol above the door on the side of the building. The door opens to a narrow stairway, leading up to a throwback bar from the 70s, wood paneling and mirrored, panoramic Bud sign included. The bar is cash only, but  the prices are the cheapest you'll find in town. There's usually a vintage movie or dance clips playing to add to the atmosphere. There's a pool table available for non-dancers who enjoy the vintage lifestyle.
After the bar, you'll find the heart of the event, the main ballroom. A perfect wood floor, 50s-style lighting, and room for dancers and tables make the ballroom comfortable for everyone.
Besides an emphasis on solid, danceable, period music, the monthly theme nights get everyone on the floor. DJs rotate throughout the night, so there's always fun new music. The Vegas swing community is fun and open, so let a DJ know if you're in from out of town for your chance to jam, and ask anyone to dance. We have more follows than leads, so ladies, please ask the gentlemen to dance, and don't be offended if they ask you for the next one. 
The cherry on top is that proceeds go to a local charity, usually to a Knights of Columbus service project in the Downtown area. Not only are you privy to one of the best-kept secrets in Vegas, drinking cheap and good drinks, and dancing with fun people, but you're doing it for a good cause!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Cool place, great for a weekday lunch (as long as you don't mind smelling like Mexican food for the rest of the day).

The taco is the best I've had in Arizona, and the super-nachos are so big, it's kind of embarrassing to walk through the restaurant with them.

Also - the bakery is excellent! You can visit twice a week for a year and try something new each time. The stuffed churros are particularly delicious.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>this cafe has SUPER good prime rib. Its not exactly conveniently located for locals unless you are headed to arizona/ boulder city or coming back.

But i higly recommend it if you are looking for reasonably priced decent prime rib.

the deserts, not so impressive.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Rick's is a bit more unassuming than some of the other bars in the same area, hiding away beneath the basement area of Frederick Street, but really a lovely, chic little place to hang out of an evening and sip a beautifully chilled and superbly bubbly prosecco, much like I recently did. Mmmmm, prosecco, can't beat some fizzy, perfect temperature, liquid joy on a beaming sunny day.

There is outside seating at Rick's, immediate tick in the bonus check list, plus it does a really tasty, classic but modern range of food, for meals at both lunch and dinner. I've done both before, and have no complaints, the service has always been friendly and efficient, and the dining experience as a whole has been really positive.

Rick's definitely handles the mix of bar and restaurant well, with most people having no qualms about just sitting at the bar having a drink, while groups eat nearby. Some bar/restaurants make this an awkward experience, but the stylish, all round good looks of Rick's, and crucially its non-pretentiousness, make it a really attractive place to have a few cocktails with friends or have a relaxed banter over some food.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Das Hotel ist "okay", wenn man keine großen Ansprüche hat. Zimmer sind sehr klein, Fenster extrem zügig (nicht im Winter reisen!) und die Einrichtung sehr abgewohnt. Das Frühstück sehr Schottisch, d.h. kein Wurst und Käse sondern Haggis, Bratwürstchen und Spiegeleier. 
Fazit: Zu einem Schnäppchenpreis</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>not a bad place for a pint before a game.... but it can get packed!!!  i also found out that they don't have a food menu... you get your food from a different part of the bar and bring it back to your seat.... 

the large outside area is awesome because it is so big...</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Tee Pee used to be one of the best Mexican restaurants in the city, but upon recently revisiting, they're no longer a stand out. Expect traditional, Sonoran-style Mexican food that's good but not great. If you're in the area craving some Mex, I wouldn't tell you to avoid it, but I won't be rushing back here any time soon...they're not much better than some Mexican restaurant chains.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is a place that I like to visit a lot, mainly for their great beer selection and the chance to play some trivia.  

The food is moderately prices, with a burger costing about $7 and a personal pizza running around $9 depending on the number of toppings. But if you like the traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza (like I do,) it's worth making the trip, especially if you like beers outside of the typical Bud Light, Coors, etc.  They have over 100 different beers, with about 25-30 on tap, and you can sign up for the "Beer Tour" and get prizes, discounts, and even your name on a plaque for the real drinkers.  Last time in, they gave me a Cinco De Mayo shirt for finishing the mini-tour, which consisted of 8 Mexican beers. Not too difficult!

Since I am a single father, I tend to go to establishments with a good atmosphere that are reasonably priced, on the rare occasions when I don't have my kids... this is one of my favorites.  Also a great place to play some trivia, if you are a trivia buff like myself.

And when I do take my kids, they love the big pan cookie topped with ice cream... one of their favorite places as well!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We went to Morton's tonight with the intention of having the $19.78 Make-A-Wish burger. Pricey for a burger, but it was at a steak house, and for a good cause. 

With the desire to end on a good note, here's the ugly:
1. It's in the Camelback Esplanade, easily the most screwed up yet supposedly upscale shopping center in the valley that smells like poo.
2. If one of the things that makes you "cool" is a verbal menu, you might want to make sure your servers know the menu. As a teacher, I have a fair amount of patience and mercy. Had we spent $200+ on dinner, which if we had partaken of their "normal" menu would have easily been the case, I would have been miffed. As it was, I was amused and a little concerned for the young man's career.
3. If Big Wong's Chinese on Indian School can consistently serve me a flawlessly cooked and completely grit-free dish of scallops for $10, why can't you manage it? 
4. You're a steak place. If you can't cook my burger correctly, do you think I'm going to risk $50 on a steak? Just sayin'... I know Ruth's Chris and Capital Grill can do it right.

Alright. It wasn't a TOTAL waste of time and money:
1. Hubby liked his 5-onion soup. I thought it was too thick and had an odd herbal or even floral bouquet. But I am not the French Onion soup connoisseur.
2. In spite of the done-ness issue, the burger was very well seasoned and tasty overall. You had a choice of 4 cheeses, onion and mushroom saute, and a side dish (any of their potato options or their standard salads). The Lyonnaise potatoes were really good, as was my baked potato, and as large as my two fists together).
3. The drinks were tasty and strong, but expensive. Their beer selection is crap. 

Ooops. What happened to the positive note? Extra star for the charity tie. There you go.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>It's not the end-all, be-all of awful...but it's sub-par.  Perhaps it's just the experiences I've had there (experiences unrelated to the bar itself) that make the bile rise in my throat when its name is mentioned.  In any case, it's a wood-paneled, dank bar with green and yellow Green Bay Packers curtains.  Do you really need to know any more about it?</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I'm giving up another local fave of mine here! 

This place is a hoot!  It's a Mediterranean place owned by three Asian women.  Toni, Suki &amp; Felice do a great job.  They bought the place from a Mediterranean family in 89 or 90 and have being doing it up ever since.

Now, I don't know how authentic all of the dishes are, but they are super tasty!  The hummus is wonderful and creamy with the warm pita.  The lentil soup is delish, creamy and full of flavor.  I love the rosemary chicken &amp; pasta dish too.  Greek salads are always fresh and crispy.  The chicken shushka is my absolute favorite -- shredded chicken cooked in a tomatoey broth over rice.  It's spicy and warm in your tummy!  I also always get a side of grilled veggies -- carrots and zucchini, I don't know how them make them taste so good.

The atmosphere is really casual, but the service is great.  If you're in here more than two or three times, the ladies will remember you.  Especially Suki -- she's the real character of the bunch.  Nothing fancy here -- paper napkins and no tablecloths.   It's almost like being at your crazy Asian auntie's house when she's having Mediterranean night.  

The wine list is just ok, so stick to Athenian beer and you'll be good to go.  Special orders are no problem and take out is easy too.

Parking can be a bit of a problem, as Med House is in the same strip mall at Richardson's and Dick's Hideaway.  Best bet is to park in the back and enter through the back door.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is one of my little boys' favorite places. I mean, what little boy-- or little girl for that matter-- doesn't at one time or another want to be a fire fighter when they grow up?

So, indulge their dreams and head on over to the Hall of Flame. Kids can gape at 90 fully restored fire trucks and other pieces of fire apparatus on display, dating back from 1725. They can play out their fireman fantasies (and gain an appreciation for how heavy and hot this gear really is) by dressing up in real fire fighter gear. And they can learn valuable safety lessons in the large hands-on exhibit area. 

This museum certainly isn't the best known museum in the area, it may not appeal to all, and it isn't very visible from any major streets. But the Hall of Flame is worth the trip -- for both kids and their grown-ups.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is a great concept with a great view of the field.  We didn't sit here for the game, but instead went in to watch batting practice.  On top of that we just had beers.  Apparently, they sell tickets for the games at the restaurant and clear out the seats a little before game time.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I've never been the first person to review a place!  I was so excited to hear that this place opened. It has only been opened a week. Yvonne helped me out.  I love these cookies. I bought a box of 10. (She gave me a couple extra though.) 
My favorites are the Kona flavored, original and coconut.  We usually get these in Oahu when we are there. Although I would rather be in Hawaii to get these,  this location is a great place to tide me over till I go back. 
If you have never tried this cookies they have samples of all the flavors they offer. =) Keep in mind that they are shortbread cookies and on the drier side.  They have prepackaged gift boxes or you can create your own box with the flavors you would like which is what I do. =)</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Think they opened about a week ago, but today was BOGO on original cream puffs for their grand opening. My friend insists that it's not as good as in LA, but it seemed the same as the ones I've had in Glendale, LA and Seattle. Light crispy shell with vanilla filling, which is all they had tonight - typical Japanese dessert that the custard filling was rich and not sweet. 

So I love Beard Papa's but I'd never go back during their obnoxious Tuesday block party. I had to literally yell my order at the cashier. They're filled to order and call your name when it's ready - too bad the music was blasting so loud that I couldn't hear sh*t. 

Its summer, and still almost 100° at night - guess what, you at least need ceiling fans in Vegas if youre going to have an open spot with no air conditioning. But no worries, they also sell $9 boba snow ice so you'll stay cool with no problem. I'll probably wait it out for this location to close so they can open in a nice air conditioned mall like normal Beard Papa's.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I only discovered this pub a couple of days ago, after going to St Stephen's to see a show. It's a little basement pub tucked away on a street just off Stockbridge. 

I like it because it's got a wee outside area with parasols, has Lia Fail and Addlestone's Cider on tap and just seems to have quite a lot of attitude. There's also this hilarious barrel behind the bar with a huge sign on it that reads "ABSINTHE! 3.75 a shot. Only two shots per person per night." Which makes me laugh, though I might be the only one who gets  a kick out of that. 

A pint of ale will cost you around 3 pounds and same goes for the cider, so it's not too pricey, though I've definitely been to cheaper places. I was pretty happy to discover this pub and I might even go so far as to say it's a bit of a gem.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is the coffee shop I staggered into when it was 20 below and I just couldn't make it all the way down State Street to Fair Trade.  My favorite things about Michelangelo's are their toasty Chai lattes and the gorgeous artistic re-renderings of Michelangelo's drawings and paintings.  Honestly, whoever created the murals in this place is amazing.  Half the time I was in here to "study" I ended up zoning out with my iPod, studying the wall art instead of econ (fine by me!)

The service is quick and friendly and the prices are good as well.  A great stop after a show at the Orpheum or post-Farmer's Market browsing around Capitol Square.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Wow, wow, wow! What a great new addition to downtown phoenix. Ross Simon the owner is a cocktail genius  &amp; is ready to please your palate on so many levels. From a Book O' Cocktails to the food menu this is going to be the new hot spot in town. I was lucky enough to enjoy a sneak peek Friday night and started off with a Singapore Sling &amp; the house popcorn (amazing!!!) the marshmallow dessert comes on a graham cracker stick served with a side of melted chocolate! So amazing. The cheese/charcuterie board is complete perfection. The ramen with cuttlefish is like nothing in Phoenix. Make this your first stop when they open their doors on May 30th. It will be a must go to place!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place is beautiful!  Very welcoming atmosphere.  The blowout bar is really fun.  Lots of different choices of styles.  

As a local I would rather stay away from the strip and this is the place to go!  Great prices, friendly staff, and great work.

Ask for Jamy to do your blowout!!!!  She did an amazing job and it only took 1/2 hour....I felt like a movie star.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>after being spoiled with real Mexican food in California, I became obsessed with finding places that served those damn delicious tacos. so, on a past trip to las vegas, i finally discovered a restaurant that did.

i got 2 carne asada (beef) and 2 birria (goat). soft, juicy, and jam packed with flavor. very authentic in my book.

i should have topped my tacos with more cilantro and onions, but was too ashamed because of the long line behind me. the sauces i took on the side were really good too; a green and red salsa.

the wait was long, but i didn't mind. i just couldn't wait to eat.

fyi: they do take out also, so be sure to call ahead if you're in a rush.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Hidden in an office building with barely any nearby parking, this eatery is easy to miss. Their 3003 N Central Ave. # 118 Phoenix address can be very misleading. There isn't any signage or entrance on N. Central Ave.  Instead, it's all on the side street, Catalina Dr.

Cranberry Hills offers breakfast and lunch for dine-in, to-go pickup or delivery and catering. For breakfast, they offer a selection of omelets, egg sandwiches, baked goods and fruit. Their lunch menu consists of standard items such as cold sandwiches, salads, pasta, pizza, soups and bakery items. 

Everything on the menu is extremely reasonably priced. You can walk out the door with a huuuuge salad for less than $7. They also offer their salads in half sizes as well. The food is all around average. The ingredients could be a little fresher at times, and I'm not too keen on the amount of iceberg lettuce that gets thrown into their salads. However they don't skimp on the toppings. Those extras get piled on top. This place is also CROWDED at lunch time. Everyone in that office park seems to eat there daily, and the parking is awful.

My favorite on the menu is #48 - the Orchard salad with a standard bed of greens, chicken strips, oranges, apples, jicama, dried cranberries and walnuts, served with country French dressing (that I usually switch out for their Roasted Red Pepper Fat Free dressing, just so save those extra calories). 

I've also used this place for catering before and for the price it's very economical and fast. They will drop off your order and set up a really awesome and professional salad bar complete with all the fixings - salad mix, nuts, cheeses, an assortment of dressings, turkey, ham, chicken, fruit, tortilla strips, etc. I've also used Cranberry Hills Catering for those last moment "oh no I forgot to order lunch and the meeting is in 4 hours from now" situations. They've saved the day for me countless times!

I wouldn't go out of my way to get their food for just an individual order. I mainly recommend this place for catering in addition to those last minute office lunch emergencies. They are fast and convenient if you work in the Mid-town Phoenix area.

Since they don't have it on here, this is a link to their Web site http://bit.ly/cLvlvG</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I've had BBQ across this great land of ours from Austin to Dallas to NYC to LA to St Louis to New Orleans and places in between and I'm gonna share a secret with you - Smoky Jon's is the best BBQ I've ever had.  The ribs and pulled pork are the most tender, perfectly smoky and best tasting i've had.  I'm not an evangelist for dry rub or wet rub or combo - all I want is good tasting grub.  The sauce here is delicious.  The sides here are also some of the best.  The baked beans have little pieces of pork in em and are super tasty.  

If you're going to the airport its right by the entrance - make a quick stop and you won't be disappointed.

FYI - Jon of Smokey Jon's has won BBQ competitions all over the US.  His BBQ grill is a huge pink pig that he hauls on the back of his truck to competitions.  Jon also is a huge big nice looking man.  He knows his BBQ probably from first hand experience.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Blech.  My brother heard this was the best Chinese buffet in Sun Prairie.  Maybe that is true, but it must be the only Chinese buffet in Sun Prairie.

I'm not giving it a hard time for "authenticity" or any of that eaither.  I love me some good Americanized, crappy Chinese food.  Here, even the stuff that was out fresh from the kitchen (which was mighty slim picken's) was barely edible.

I was really looking forward to some good old MIdwestern Chinese buffet, too.  The Chinese food options in Portland are actually very lacking, the last really good stuff I had was from a strip mall in Crawfordsville, IN.  Seriously, they can do it right but everyone else serves lukewarm, tasteless piles of mystery?  Gotta be kidding me.

Most options seemed to have been sitting for way too long when we got here, and it was peak dinner eating time.  I should have been tipped off by the low number of patrons at this "best Chinese" but I like to give the benefit of the doubt.

You are better off making Ramen noodles at home and calling it chinese food.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Went here yesterday to see the drag show with my friend (and fellow transperson) Fenyx.

Cruisin had everything I would ever want out of a bar; seedy atmosphere, cheap drinks, a stage, friendly bartenders, and trannies, crossdressers, and drag queens as far as the eye could see. For a moment I felt how Robert Smith must feel whenever he walks into a Hot Topic, or Hulk Hogan in a bandana wholesaler's. 

But alas, like Torrid and Guitar Center, I inevitably showed up the same day as the token asshole employee whose brief interaction with me would ruin my view of this establishment for all time.

While waiting for the show to commence, Fenyx and I went through the back door to take a smoke break, as were a lot of other people. The back door couldn't be shut all the way or it would lock, forcing you to either bang on it until someone heard you over the music or walk around to the other side. 

So he and I are just standing around, smoking, talking, making sure nobody shuts the door, and out comes the DJ. He steps out, and before even lighting his cigarette, slams the door behind him.

"Awwww, man, now you've locked us out," we say, playfully.

The DJ stands over Fenyx, eyeballing him as he responds with "Yeah, that's the point. To keep the undesirables out" before walking off with his cigarette.

"What the hell just happened?" I ask.
"He thinks we're a straight couple." 
I laughed. I searched for a pen. I'd been mistaken for a lot of things in the past, but this was the first time I'd been mistaken as straight. This had to be documented. Fenyx, who is also not straight, was not as amused.

I tried to brush the comment aside and we went back inside, where the DJ proceeded to stare down my amigo and I from across the bar. 

I knew at any moment, a confrontation would escalate, and I was forced to choose between leaving early, missing the drag show, or watch the tension rise to eruption. One of these scenarios carried with it the slight risk of me breaking a newly manicured nail, so naturally, I opted we go back to the Bunkhouse and play darts.

I'm sure giving them 1 star for this one incident is petty, but, uh, so is what they did, so it works out, I guess.

Oh well. Torrid and Guitar Center seem to do just fine without my business. I'm sure Cruisin 7th will do just fine.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Great place for Italian.  Definitely chose here rather than the location on State Street for a more intimate, less college-heavy environment.  I've been here with various boyfriends and every time was memorable...hey, I even remember their names!!!  Highly recommended...check out the pesto.  Up there with Portabella for best Italian downtown.  5 stars.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>It's good to have this restaurant back. The menu is pretty much the same as before. The tacos are still inexpensive and very good, and the fried onions and jalapeno served on the side are a really nice touch; and they have the best horchata I've had in Phoenix. The counter area may seem cluttered with cases of soda, but the rest of the restaurant is orderly and the service is fast.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This review might be a little unfair because I just had a fantastic lobster roll from the foodie fest event  that just rolled up here in Vegas from the Lobster Lady truck. But here it goes.
LobsterMe's lobster roll was embarrassing bad. First it hardly had any lobster. I did only order the large but  the bread to meat ratio was about 3 parts bread 1 part meat, I would say less then 3 ounces of meat.  The roll was very dry, hard and a bit stale.
 The menu did look pretty interesting and I was planning on going back and trying some other items,  but I don't think I'll be going back. Honestly I felt like i was ripped off.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Forno Fabbri is a slice of Italian life. Their delectable pastries and cappuccinos remind me of the true Italian style breakfasts I used to have in Florence. Their lunch menu (available until 5pm) is affordable and extensive, featuring items such as soups, salads, pizza by the slice and sandwiches. Their paninis are to die for. My two favorites are the crudo baguette panino and the caprese foccacia panino. The kale romana salad is incredible. Their very authentic "pizza romana" is something not often seen stateside, but definitely worth checking out. If you're curious about the mozzarella bar, meat balls and cheese boards, be sure to go after 5pm to see that menu! The team of Italian servers know their stuff and make excellent wine pairing suggestions. It is also worth mentioning that they are unfortunately closed every Sunday, which is something unmistakably Italian as well.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>It's inside F.A.M.E. located at the Linq and probably a 4 minute walk from the High Roller Ferris Wheel. If you use your GPS and type in Linq Ave it will direct you to the street you need. We parked in Valet. From there you walk up to cobblestone street once you go past the beautiful water fountain it's on the right hand side across from the pizza place. Look for the sign F.A.M.E. It's right as you walk in.

Now to get to the food! I'm not much of a adventurous person, I like some Japanese cooking &amp; my boyfriend raves about the food truck meets. He brings all his friends from out of town to try it. Heck even a friend of ours from Rhode Island visited and even HE said it was delicious. I know the food truck has quite a major following on their Facebook page!

I ordered a number one burger no tomato, onion, ginger. I added BACON &amp; Shiitake mushrooms (additional toppings are $1.99 EACH). Togarshi Garlic fries have a little KICK to them, but nothing I can't wash down with a Pepsi (32 oz. 3.49). Togarshi Garlic fries come with a side of crack sauce, it's very addicting. The sauce came on my burger and I really loved the flavors. This place is far from bland. You grab your own drinks, no waiter service which is fine with me.

I really enjoyed eating here and I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a shock to the taste buds. Also F.A.M.E. has free Wifi if you're interested. I'd like to come back.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Oh jeez I hate it when spring roles around and the drive through starts to smell... If you go to the drive through, be ready to keep your windows up because the grease box in the back STINKS... ugh - going through in a convertible to satisfy my oreo blizzard jones was enough to ruin my appetite. 

Service is OK except in two cases, which unfortunately happen often: 1) a crowd of people inside; or 2) some in front at the drive through ordering multiple items. 

To be fair, all the ice cream items (why order anything else at DQ?) are fine, as good as any other DQ. But the outside stench at the drive through and slow service limit me to only two stars.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I have to concur with Shannon and Sarah on this one. 

In high school, we used to get out n Friday's at 12:30 and then we would rendezvous with our lady friends for lunch. There were an amazingly high number of awkward teenage lunches that took place at this Duck and Decanter, until one day I realized that I really don't like the food there, or anything about it really. 

It somewhat effectively passes itself off as a gourmet sandwicheria/deli but more by pricing everything high than serving good sandwiches. 

I'll still drop by from time to time and still have friends from high school that love it, I just don't think I ever will. 

Two and a half stars.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place rocks! I am very happy to have a local place that we all like. The staff are super sweet and helpful. The service is really great and reliable. Everything is clean and comfortable. They are very helpful from the seating to special requests.
The seating is a pretty metallic blue. The atmosphere is much nicer than you'd expect for a small Chinese place.
 Can't beat the lunch specials for 6.25 the deal is over the top especially since the portions are pretty generous. If the entrée you want isn't on the official menu for lunch they might still make it for you if you ask, they made me moo goo gai pan one day ( no extra charge).
 They have dinner specials too. You can eat here on the cheap. The food itself seems very clean and fresh. Not bland, yet uninvolved as in no junk and artificial heavy sauces. Things taste more authentic and healthy here.
 Everyone has liked everything we tried out so far. The only thing worth mentioning is the sweeter meals like sweet and sour chicken, lemon chicken and orange chicken etc are very sugary so if you are diabetic take heed. Those dishes are great tasting but they aren't for you if you can't have much sugar and need to watch your intake.

 They are very quick when you call in an order. I have never been kept waiting once, not once!! That's so great!
  I think it's actually faster than Panda  where I always seem to get stuck behind the most indecisive people or worse the person throwing a huge party and has them cooking up a storm for a party tray or two.... And I swear some people act as if they never saw teriyaki chicken before in their life and take 3 hours to decide in that place! So before you die of old age waiting in line just check this place out, they'll have you cooked and ready by the time you'd even get to the register across the street! :) ( Not hatin' on Panda their staff is good, it's just the customers....)

 Also They have a lot of sushi here, I have never had sushi so I can't comment. But I am betting it's good.

All in all reliable service and food. A++++++++++++++++++++++</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>OMG.  A Vegas Walmart.  Do Not Want.   In a modern interpretation this would be one of Dante's nine circles of hell.  

They should just hand out packs of condoms to everyone who enters this place, and if they ask why, shove a mirror in their face.    

Go to Target, spare yourself.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>OMG I LOVE this stuff!!!  I used to buy the oils and vinegars all the time, primarily at the arts and craft shows in San Jose and Campbell Ca.   We moved to North Carolina 2 yrs ago and can not get this anywhere.  After the mind blowing devastation wore off and my brain clicked back on I went on line and ordered several bottles to keep me in good standing with the fam!!!  My favorite is the Basil Garlic Parmesan, I pour a little in a pan and add cut up chicken, bell peppers and onions... once its warmed put on a tortilla with some cheese a little lettuce and some ranch and it is the BEST chicken wrap ever</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>A top notch club that doesn't rob you at the door in cover charges and then at the bar in drink prices! They offered free cover and the drink were very reasonably priced at $7 domestics, $8 well drinks, $9 mid, $10 top shelf and they also offered a local discount on top of that as well as bottle specials.. I'd recommend this club to anyone looking to have a epic night out, they have great staff with beautiful entertainers that will give you twice the service for half the cost</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>A lovely little restaurant with nice intimate settings. Food was lovely and so fresh tasting - king prawn and chicken satay starters were excellent. Was looking forward to mixed fish dish for the main but they were out of scallops which was a bit disappointing. However they made up by substituting them with octopus. 

Have had takeaway from here in the past and been impressed. Recommended.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is a pool sharks paradise. Don't play anyone you don't know, even if you think you're good, you're nothing compared to these guys.

At least the pool table is in good nick (this guys would probably murder you if you spilled something on it). The staff were really suprised to see us in there, like the only youths they see are the grankids once a year.

Look out for the guy with the wonky moustash, he has last weeks yelp wages!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Location is everything. 

Located on my usual stumble home, Pizza Extreme is quickly becoming my 3 AM stop of choice.  Bring a couple of friends, randomly select 5 items (ranging from chicken drummies to pizza of decent quality), and head home to play some Tekken.  If you're a couple 7&amp;7's into your night, you will not be disappointed.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>If you've ever played "Cafe World" you will recognize this place as the first level if they had a Mexican version. One very cute petite lady running around, and taking everyone's orders, and then running in the back to cook it up....then she comes back out poised and collected, serves you calmly, and then runs back in the kitchen to cook someone else's order, only to come back in time to clear your dishes, etc...

What really endeared me to this place was the obvious pride in non-franchised ownership. The clear plastic tablecloths over the handmade lace ones...the server/cook/owner's propriety when she brought Hubs an iced tea with an actual iced tea spoon ( I hadn't seen one in years!) It all reminded me of my little Sicilian aunts and the way I imagine they ran their tiny little speakeasies (yes, I have mafia in my blood!) back in the day....

If the food had been incredible, I would've jumped on the table and danced the Macarena.....but alas, they put the "meh" in Mexican. I had the chile rellenos, and it came with a side of beans and rice...all fine, but forgettable.

I imagine I would LOVE this place if they had a liquor license ;)</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I agree with the other reviewer.........this place is ok.  Food is not terrible...but it's not the best I've had.   I got the ribs w/ side + corn bread for $12.  That's about the going rate for 1/2 rack of ribs....but you sit outside at a table in the parking lot.

The BBQ is tasty......the meat was fairly tender but not hot.

If you're in the area, it's worth a try.  But, it's not in the same category as say Sam's Cafe or Keegans for ribs.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Bachi has a breakfast restaurant?! What!! Obsessed with Bachi Burger as it is, and super disappointed by their ramen, I'm glad HLK lives up to the Bachi name. 

My friends and I are fatties and had the Bella farms foie gras de canard (torchon, jelly, marcona almonds, cornichons, cranberry walnut bread) as a starter. Delicious! It has a pretty thick layer of duck fat on top as well. Yeah, as disgusting as you may feel thinking about eating straight up fat, who cares? Spread that stuff on! 

I had the wild mushroom hash (potato, kale, gruyere, egg, fried onions, bechamel) as well as the corned beef hash (potato, brussel sprouts, onion, egg, bechamel) . No, not all too myself, I'm not that much of a fatty. Disappointed a bit, because none of us were asked how we wanted our eggs cooked. On both hashes they came over hard, which I hate. I love runny yolks, don't take that away from me! Especially on a hash. But other than that, they were both delicious. Corned beef had good flavor. 

Friend got the braised short ribs loco modo ( two eggs, fried rice, onion rings, orange lentil gravy). Looked bomb. Meat was tender. Braised for thirty six hours. 

Also tried the crispy sweet chili chicken and waffle (apple bacon, brussel sprouts, green onion waffle, curry butter). Chicken was very moist, and the sauce on it was delicious. Unfortunately they only put it on one of the pieces. Waffle was ok. Butter ess definitely the high point of the waffle. You get three choices of syrups (maple, coconut, blueberry). 

Overall, good experience. Great service. Thanks Adrianna! Definitely a come back spot.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Built out of an old Country Kitchen, this friendly neighborhood bar and grill has lots of room.  Great food at a reasonable price too I might add.  If you are a sports fan, this is a great bar...several TV sets with your favorite games.  If it's your birthday, you'll get to drink free tap beer all night long too.  The employees are very friendly and attentive.  Visti the website: http://www.silvereaglebar.net/</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Since moving to Wisconsin, I have been searching for good grilled cheese sandwiches.  And, Melted certainly fits the bill.

I had the American Caprese sandwich, and it was a solid sandwich.  The pesto and tomatoes added a nice tang to the flavor.  I thought it was better than the grilled cheese at the Old Fashioned and Coopers Tavern, but not as good as Monty's.

All sandwiches come with a shot of tomato soup, which is not particularly remarkable.

The drawback was the price.  The basic sandwich is $6 and the specialty sandwiches are $8.  That was steep for a small, food-cart sandwich without a side.  In fact, I went over to Ian's right after for a slice of pizza to make a full lunch.

Again, the sandwich was quite good.  However, I would prefer to buy a slice of Ian's mac and cheese pizza and a slice of caprese pizza and a bag of puppy chow for the same price.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This butchers for me has sadly gone downhill. Having purchased oxtail which went off after two days and then mince which was full of bone fragments. They don't seem concerned either, wrote to them enclosing fragments 4 wks ago, they did not even respond. Lesson learned: Deal with face to face. I am giving them 2 stars for their steak which is good, zero for customer service. I. family &amp; friends will not be returning to this butchers.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>It isn't easy to find good sushi in Phoenix. Usually, even if you do find it, you have to subject yourself to annoying house beats and dress up like you're going clubbing afterwards to fit in. 

Which is why Moto is such an aberration. It's sandwiched between a Blockbuster and McDonalds at 16th St. and Glendale, so the cheezy factor can pretty much be immediately ruled out. 

I remember this when it was still a Shogun Express, which I also enjoyed, but I must say, I like Moto even more. They have some creative appetizers including the Asian Nachos, which are essentially nachos with sour cream and chicken and guacamole but instead of tortilla chips, they use fried wontons. Genius, I tell you. 

Happy hour prices are more than fair and the Caterpillar and Spicy Tuna rolls are some of the best I've found. Try the all-you-can-eat deal on the weekends, too . . . Hard to beat.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>One of my favorite food to eat is pizza and when i found this place while visiting some friends in Mesa decided to eat here. I was pleased by the food and was surprised to read all the bad reviews. The pizza was good and the pepperoni rolls were the best. The food was a little greasy but what do you expect from a pizza joint. They also had a good selection of beers, that was very impressive.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I love the goofy chicago shit on the walls, and the haphazard menus that dont make any sense all over the walls. It is the first place where I actually felt like it could belong in Chicago. The guy that owned it was obviously from a big city back east, just by looking at him and talking. 

The food though? Not so good al.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Same Ol' - Same Ol'  What did ya expect!   Still, if you want some caffeine, and you need it now, here's the place to juice up right before making that visit to Good Samaritan Hospital down the block to see a hurting bro or sista!

Located just on the north/west corner of 7 th and McDowell in a little strip mall of about four other businesses.  Next door to Einstein Bagels as their neighbor companion and moderate outside seating.  Indoor seating is slim at best and not much in the way for room.  Just a thin suite for the in&amp;out feeling (Move it! Move it!)...

Let's try and get excited about this Starbucks!----???----Well, there is a Bus Stop for local transit just in front!----That should lift your grocery bags some---or at least your duffel bag....

During the day I felt like ordering a double-shot instead of getting shot at!  That's a positive!  (not sure about night though?...)</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Cheryl and Ashley Cole

Let's look at the facts. 

Ashley Cole is indicated on numerous occasions, in various tabloid rags, of taking part in gay orgies in football club showers.

Cheryl Tweedy is convicted of having physically and racially assaulted a black toilet attendant.

How do they quash the rumors and restore their public reputations? They get married.

I was suspicious of this sham from the very start. I think it was when I saw the dubious pair on a TV show and he was calling her "mate" in his particularly annoying and whiney "Sarrf Lundun" accent that clinched it. It just seemed wrong.

Which brings me on to Cargo. If the aforenamed duo were a boozer this would be it. The place just doesn't add up. Similarly to the odd couple, its undeniably well finished and excellently presented, but something just doesn't work. It's partly it's location, and almost definitely contributed to by it's vastness, but when you go there you just can't get comfortable. It's awkward, and doesn't endear you to stay. I was in it during the 6 Nations this year and have honestly never been in such an atmosphere deprived watering hole before or since. There was a couple of guys on lap tops, the barely audible hubbub of the 7 other punters in the background, and a dire need on my part to down my glass of Stella and GTF. 
Around the back of the downstairs room the seats are comfy, but you can't see anything because there's all these pillars in the way, and they're not even real, they're just for show. It just doesn't make sense. Unless you're a YP city type looking for a hideaway to suck copious quantities of coke up your drug ravaged beak, they have no point.

I must complement it on it's patio area/beergarden out by the canal. It is an excellent summer hideaway, and I someday intend to drunkenly humiliate myself there before stumbling home and yet again, soiling myself while on the phone to the Samaritans.

Anyway, I imagine "Chez and Ash" would feel right at home in the place, it seems like it would be their bag. That's if their inevitable and predictable demise hadn't got in the way first. Boo-fucking-hoo.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I've been past the intersection of 43rd Avenue and Union Hills countless times, but not until recently did I notice the sign for Sam's Pizza.  Curiosity got the better of me and I checked out the website.  Seemed like an interesting place with the Chicago style thin crust.  Convinced the wife and we headed over to check it out.

I was expecting a restaurant with table service for some reason, but instead it was like a Ray's or Sardella's where you order at the counter and they bring it to you.  There were only 4-5 tables in the place, seating 2 each...I'm assuming much of their business comes from takeout and delivery.  We were the only people in there and the counter help was friendly and quick.  Our drinks came out quick.  My soda tasted a little flat, but not horrible.

The wife and I each ordered "Sam's Mini-Sampler" which is a personal pizza w/ five hot wings.  The wings came out first, and you could tell they were straight out of the fryer, as they were quite hot (temperature).  The hot sauce was not overwhelming and had a nice taste to it...however, the underlying chicken, not so good.  It didn't have good flavor and also seemed a little rubbery, so maybe it had been fried a little bit too much?  Anywho, by this point, at least 15 minutes had passed since we made our order and no pizza.  This is only a problem b/c the menu notes that the personal pizza is ready in 10 minutes or less usually.  As there was no one there...it should have been ready quicker.  

The pizza came out and smelled good.  It also was a great size for a one person meal.  The flavor of the pizza was good as well, though if you don't like tomato sauce on the sweet side (kind of reminded me of Spinato's) you might not like this.  The one down side of the pizza was that while the crust was thin, the bottom was not at all crispy which the menu had me believing it would be.  

Overall, Sam's was ok.  I liked the pizza (which I would have gotten the roasted garlic topping instead of plain cheese) but did not care for the wings or the wait.  The wife didn't particularly like it, so it is not likely that I'll be back.   Three stars, nothing extraordinary, nothing underordinary.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I had always resisted going to Rosati's because they don't usually have any seating available, so imagine my surprise (and delight) when I found out that this Rosati's (on Mineral Point) did indeed have seating and full wait-service!

With the first "blizzard" of 2009 breathing down our neck, we ventured over to Rosati's to try their pizza.  Folks at work raved about it, so we set our expectations high.  We arrived and were pleased to discover they were open and that they did indeed have plenty of seating (6 large booths, a few tables, and a bar to sit at).

The waitress invited us in and told us to sit wherever we'd like.  As we were sitting down, she brought us complimentary popcorn, along with the menus.  Tonight's special was fried chicken, but we opted for the double dough meat lover's pizza.  We added a Miller Lite and a couple of sodas for good measure.

Pizza arrived; it was h-u-g-e.  Their "large" is closer to an extra-large if you'd ask me... We took our first bite, and - yum.  The cheese was fantastic - very flavorful, great texture, and perfectly proportioned.  The toppings were tasty as well - fresh and flavorful.  The sauce had just a hint of a kick, which was a pleasant surprise.

I'm not sure that I'd order the double dough crust again (they have thin, double dough, Chicago style, and stuffed); I'd probably try the thin, as the double was just a tad too bready for my liking, but that's really nit-picking on my part.  

The service was absolutely awesome - our waitress checked-in several times, made sure our drinks were always full, and followed up at the perfect intervals.  Top notch, for sure!  We will definitely be back.

Rosati's = WIN

Service = 5 stars (fantastic!!! friendly and helpful)
Food = 4 stars (very solid pizza)
Value = 4 stars ($26 for large pizza + drinks)
MIsc = 4 stars (great menu variety, nice seating area)

Summary: It's not often that you get great service from a pizza place, let alone a place that specializes primarily in delivery and carry out.  Combine Rosati's awesome service, huge menu, their delicious pizza, and the great overall value and you can't go wrong.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Pretty sure this is the dive-iest dive I've ever been to.

They have bar shuffleboard (LOVE IT), are sort of lenient about checking IDs (as in they don't?), and always have groups of rowdy drunkies ready to start fights and talk shit, which always proves to be an interesting time.

My 3-star rating is not indicative of a classy, safe place, but rather one that after leaving, we always have a good story for the next day at work starting with "Holy shit man, you'll never guess what happened last night at Baja's...."</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Bert's has apparently got 9 ales on tap, which should be enough information to immediately lure the majority of beer/lager/ale drinkers through the pub's doors. However, I'm not really keen on beer, so it isn't enough to lure me, however the fact Bert's is a pretty awesome wee pub, ales or not, is sufficient to get me to attend here on a night out.

Bert's has a really nice traditional feel to it, and having a few drinks here is always a laidback affair. It does show a lot of sport, so gets pretty packed during rugby season. Outside seating is also a bonus, as William St is actually a really nice little street to sit out on. You've also got Teuchters, another very good pub, across the road if you're planning to visit more than one establishmennt.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I remember loving the Isobar back in 2005/2006, but these days it's seems to lack any real character.

The staff are welcoming enough, and the drink selection is pretty good (and well priced), but the place feels a little sterile.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I was so excited to see a new place come to the neighborhood, went in on a Saturday afternoon &amp; ordered a cheeseburger &amp; small fries &amp; a bacon cheeseburger for husband. The food was greasy and slippery the patties fell out of soggy buns the fries were soggy in some parts and still raw in other sections :( for two cheeseburgers &amp; 1 small fry it was $20 . Which if food was good not biggie but you can go have in &amp; out for much better quality and about half the price for combos.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I'm a Caffè Nero fan myself (I have a few months supply of their beans at home), however, needs must when nowt is around.

I had a Triple Espresso using their Ethiopian Blend as I wanted it ASAP (as STRONG as possible). It did not disappoint.

I also chose an "All day breakfast bap". This was ok and filled a gap, but, that's it really.

Pleasant service.

Indoor &amp; outdoor seating.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Best sandwiches!!! I am very sad however that I  will be driving to another location from now on. They were very rude and acted like we were asking them to walk 10 miles because we asked them to put our orders on separate tickets. The assistant manager rolled her eyes and acted like she wanted to slap us. Then, when I asked to add chips and a drink to my order the girl told me to hold on, gave me my coin change and kept my 11 dollars and set it in front of her. She added my chips, rang me up then tried to hand me back a few quarters. I then asked her about my drink and she informed me that I didn't order a drink. I told her never mind. When I asked her for the rest of my change she told me she gave it to me. I told her, "no you didn't" and she got an attitude and told me, "I know for a fact I gave you your change." I emptied my pockets and showed her all I had was the coin change she gave me. Then the Assistant manager  Donna again acting like we were bothering her told her just to give it to me and she would count it later. Well then when I tried to call the manager Carlos, he was in a meeting and then left. I guess the business of our office and corporate office meeting once a month are not important enough for him to call me back. 
VERY BAD SERVICE, IF I WAS THE OWNER, I WOULD FIRE THESE RUDE PEOPLE AND START OVER WITH PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS!!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>CHIPS and SALSA (2 kinds) and BEAN DIP all while you wait for your food.  Don't bother ordering appetizers, the chips and dips will satisfy you.  If you like margaritas, order the jumbo marg and sit in the nice air conditioned room.  Arriba is Mexican food, nothing fancy with a twist- just good ol' Mexican food.  You know the kind you eat and say "why oh why did I just eat all that?".  I come here ever so often.  I had the carnitas just recently and was was very happy with my meal.  Have Fun!  Prices range anywhere bettwen $9-$15ish.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Ate there last night for the first time. it was pasta night. for 9.95 you get the salad bar and a chef prepared pasta dish. it was very good. taking friends and parents there next week. chef was super nice and very helpful in helping you decide what you wanted. he wasnt pushy and didnt try to hurry you. i even got a free creme brulee (my favorite dessert) from him. he created a strawberry one. very yummy. they have a chicken bufett on tue. (have not tried it yet but want to) and prime rib on friday and saturday. dont know what took us so long to finally go to this place but im sure we will be regulars now. much better than the duke i think.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This location does not offer daily specials, but the Maryland Parkway location does. They also don't seem very bright, but the portions seem bigger here than other locations I go to.  They do the Tuesday 99 cent deal for 2 pieces, which is a real bargain.  The regular menu is kinda pricey, so I'm stickin with the Wicked Chicken Basket for $3.99 whenever it's in season.  I miss the Popcorn Chicken special.  I always ask for spicy, and sometimes they mess up and give me regular.  Oh well.  :-P</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I broke down and was craving McDonald's and wanted to check out the newly built one. Ordered the new bacon clubhouse burger. It was tasty but on the cooler side of hot. Once again though fries as bad as you can get. Cold, dried out and down right uneatable. I do like that they have coke zero even as it wasn't mixed properly. 
Service, what service. No warm welcome or even a smile and it was a manager who was besides himself for having to leave his set position to help me the only customer at noon in line. 
Dining room looks great new. Dirty as all hell. Looked to sit at 3 high tables and all the seats had greasy soda spots all over them. 
How hard is it to manage a place like this. I've done it quiet successfully for many years. 
And yes someone can contact me if they'd like.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place had little selection. I was excited there was an asian market that opened right next to my place. However, when I checked it out cause I needed some last minute vegetables for the sinigang I was going to make I noticed that the vegetables they had were basically rotting already. The sitaw (chinese long beans) I was going to buy there had brown spots all over them already and were definitely over priced. I can see that they had all the canned filipino foods people may need to make some filipino dishes which is a good thing. But I think this place definitely needs more products in order to really blossom. This store has potential to explode but not with the little selection of vegetables and filipino foods they have. It is at a convenient place right next to Mountain's Edge neighborhood, but they need to defintely up their products.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Every Wisconsin fatty loves a good butterburger, we all know that, but what sets this Culvers apart from the others is the fact that its hands down the best one in Madison, and maybe even Wisconsin. The food is always hot,fresh,well prepared,and served quickly and politely. The other thing is its cleanliness. Its restrooms are always very clean and smell good, and the tables are quickly bussed and wiped down to make room for the next customer. The floors are kept immaculate, and you will never see a mess on the floor or at the condiment station. I think this is because the owner takes great pride in his resteraunt, and is always there. I know this because I live close and eat here 3 times a week, and he's always there. Most of the staff has worked there for a long time as well, and are good at their job. This place is the blueprint of what a Culvers should be,and a shining star among the companys resteraunts.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We went here today looking for some authentic Scotish cuisine and I was very impressed. The location is very good for those exploring Edinburghs old town and famous royal mile. The decor was a bit old skool with some tacky pictures on the wall but when the food arrived you will no longer notice them because our meal was delicious.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I agree with Fiona - it's not bad, but it's not great either.
Centotre is sort of like the sheepish kid in the back row not really saying much while all the big kids shout and play. How's that for an analogy!!

Everything is very samey samey. The decor is lovely though, they have the circle theme throughout, and bright, bold panels of pink. They have great cocktails though, and the staff take their duties very seriously.
They always have lots to do though - I think they try to make up in entertainment what they lack in va va voom. Check out their website for all the latest events!

The website is brilliant too - they have heaps of cocktail recipes and a good sense of humour.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>A victim of its own coolness.  We travel A LOT and here are some things we couldn't figure out how to do in our room:  Turn up the heat (it's motion sensor and it didn't sense us for awhile), turn off the lights, drain the bath.  Also, they could really use an additional door in the bathroom by the toilet.

Having said all that, this is actually a beautiful hotel, in a perfect location with a super nice, helpful staff.  Great bed too.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The smell of this baked potato shop drives me crazy. You know how some people say that oysters is an aphrodisiac? I would argue that the smells wafting out of Tempting Tattie would weaken the knees of the most upstanding gentleman/lady.

They have a great selection of fillings - everything you would expect from a baked potato shop. The potatoes themselves are nothing short of perfect - exactly how a tattie should be. I loved the tuna mayo and sweetcorn, it's really chilled and so works well with the steamy potato. My friend just had cheese and she said it was the best baked potato she'd ever had.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Couldn't agree with Stephanie more - I feel like a fish out of water in Edwards.

I remember this particularly living up to its stereotype - generic chain bar, tries to be cocktail but its main appeal is cheap, easy booze, blares out music impossibly loud and pulsatingly terrible.

Being a low maintenance, jeans and t shirt kind of girl, I felt totally out of place rolling in with T in the Park hair and baggies. This was not a self conscious misconception, the bar was just insipid. Being little over five foot, I was stretched tip toe-ing over the bar for over half an hour before I got served. It's the kind of place guys barge in front of you and no, they're not sorry. They steam roller over most ladies and the most you'll get out of them is a burp (or on Saturday night, a barf).

This bar attracts people who want so desperately to be trendy but the only trend I see forming is regurgitated cocktails lying sprawled on the pavement.

Harsh, yes. But fair? Aye. Sorry Edwards, you don't make me shake my money maker.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Love this place. We visited Glasgow site last summer after hearing about it and and were super delighted to hear of Edinburgh opening, ON THEIR FIRST BIRTHDAY too! We just randomly arrived when we could, which happened to be 3.30-4pm on a Thursday, so it wasn't busy, but we didn't want a busy place so suited us! They've done great things with the space (much improved and simplistic) and actually we instantly found the chilli fries and wings to be superior to Glasgow...the burgers (fiery ones) were delicious but the actual meat alone was dry and overcooked slightly..Altogether it was still a brill tasty burger experience and you could tell the meat was good, but it had turned kind of grey and dry and we were super glad of all the accompaniments....

We were charged extra for bacon we didn't ask for, but we DID ask for cheese so didn't say anything at bill time, though only one of us got cheese and both got bacon - pretty strange mistakes for an empty restaurant...

But we heart new indy places owned by enthusiastic-hard-working individuals who just want to get the message across that their product is simple, delicious and affordable. We'll be back....again and again!!!!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Having recently fallen in love with Chicago style pizza, I have been trying to find a place around my apartment that serves some good Chicago pies. When I drove past this place and saw the sign, I knew I was going to have to check it out some time.

I checked out their website during the football games this weekend and my mouth started watering. I knew what my dinner was going to be and I was still eating lunch. I was in trouble, my stomach wanted the pizza as soon as possible. I ended up waiting a few hours to order. Seeing that the website says the serve spinach, I was a bit excited. Spinach and sausage might be my favorite toppings for a pizza. I order and was told it should be ready in around 40 minutes, though it seemed like he didn't know whether to tell me 40-50 minutes. I game my name and number just like when ordering at all other places. 

A bit later, I drive over to pick it up. The place isn't much to look at. You walk in and there are BRIGHT yellow tiles covering the wall. The counter is right in front of you with a lamppost on one side of the room and a bench on the other. I tell the cashier my name and that I am here to get my spinach and sausage pizza. She replies, 'The sausage one?' I was then informed that the decided not to serve spinach any more, even though its on the website and in the menu, which I checked while I waited the minute or two for them to finish the pizza. I wasn't really upset, just curious as to why they didn't call. I had given them my number for them to call if anything should happen. I would figure you would call your customer to let them know you don't have a topping he asked for that you let him think you had.

I get in my car and drive home with the pleasant smell of pizza filling the air. I get home and immediately dig in. It looks like the perfect Chicago pizza. And it was a very good pizza. The issue is the crust. They use a cornmeal crust and it tastes very different from a normal crust. It was also a much thicker crust than I was expecting. I am not an expert on Chicago style, but I didn't thin the crust was normally half of the pizza. This wasn't a big deal either because it was actually quite tasty and had plenty of cheese, sausage and sauce on it so the crust wasn't overwhelming. 

It was a delicious pizza. I don't want every pizzeria to switch to this type of crust, but it was nice for a change of pace. They have a good mix of crust, sauce and toppings to really make a complete pie with no one part taking over the pie. I just wish they had given me a call to let me change my order, but I won't hold it against them and will think about them the next time I am looking for a good pie. Not authentic Chicago pie (from what I know) but still ,a darn good one.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Gotta give a big THANKS! to this Walgreens.  I found myself there shoeless with an overheated dog and they had no problem letting me come in with the dog to buy some water for him.  It is rare for a big chain store to be so dog and barefoot friendly!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Been here a few times over the last 5+ years but I must be getting older or the crowd has really changed.

The music was average, some Latin pop/dance stuff.

If I was exaggerating about this next comment than I would be a pig, but it's the truth, --- there was a LOT of very large women here, all in their shinny, way too short, way too tight clothes.  Again, sorry but it was the truth.

Had a couple of drinks and left.  Didn't even go hang around the under 21 section downstairs.  Just kidding, I would never do that.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Nice menu. Nice clean ambiance. The food is just okay. My recent experience was the chicken enchilada lunch special which was served tepid. It should be hot. The chicken was canned and it reminded me of tuna. The whole thing didn't sit well with me. I'll go back in a pinch, but I'm not gonna race back.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>"Met expectations" is about how I would sum it up.  Standard Asian Buffet with Americanized Chinese, about a dozen different choices of sushi roles (even some sashimi that I skipped), a Mongolian grill station, a noodle soup station (had roast duck for the noodle soup but I did not try it), and an American station.  By "met expectations" I mean that the food ranged from ok to no-so-ok (the baked salmon fillet was dryer than I thought salmon could get), with none of it great.  That said, it's cheap, and one of the cheaper place to get sushi for my kid, who thinks the sushi from the case at Woodmans is "great" (so why should I take him to Murimoto?) 

Will probably be back when the kids ask for it since it is close to home and one kid can get sushi and the other can get pizza.  

Service was good, plates were cleared quickly between rounds at the buffet. 

Take-out is available by the pound.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I like pizza. I don't eat it often though. I like to get away from the chain food producers in many cases and find independent local businesses for pizza generally no matter where ever I live. However no one does a Pan Pizza like Pizza Hut! So I often crave the Pan Pizza crust Supreme Pizza and when I go for one or have one delivered, I am never disappointed. The crust is always consistent as are the multiple toppings I so enjoy. And i so appreciate that about Pizza Hut, which I can't say the same of other national pizza chains.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We just visited Phoenix for a long weekend and this was on our short list of restaurants to hit up. We lived in Phoenix for almost seven years and have always loved LGO's food (Postino and Chelsea's Kitchen too!) This time did not disappoint. We were there on the 4th of July and a few of us enjoyed the 4 cent sangria. Our table shared pizzas which were perfect and everyone left happy.

We ate breakfast there the next day and everything from the drinks (coffee and freshly squeezed OJ) to the food (pancakes and eggs) were awesome. The staff is friendly, the ambiance lovely. A total win.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The first time I went to Karamba's it was for Pride. I went for after hours and it was amazing! I paid my $5 cover fee and went into what looked like an industrial style bar. There were tables being hung from the celing and there were also a backdoor to the outside patio as well as a the ladies restroom. When we went deeper into the club, the blue hued bar gave way to the deep red dance floor. There were tables for dancing on as well as a plush looking chill section. 

The dance floor was PACKED with men grinding up on men, with women griding up on women and the ocassional straight couple peppered into the crowd as well as a few large groups of women dancing together. Oddly enough there's often a lot of straight women who go there with their bffs so they can dance in peace. There's some chairs and more hanging tables surrounding the dance floor. 

Then there's the outside patio... there's a few water foutains and a ton of patio chairs, benches and tables. Sometimes it feels like the patio is where the real party is at! 

Since that weekend, I've been a regular there. I'm sure if you venture there for afterhours some Friday or Saturday night you'll see yours truely tearing it up on the dance floor to some of the hottest hip-hop and reggeton around! If you do, pull me away from my friends and say hi! Hope to see ya'll there!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place is awesome. Came here on opening night (accidentally) I'm a local came to check out the Linq outdoor area which is awesome. So Soul Live they were really really great. Had dinner food was pretty good I'd give it a B+ service was speller though! What a cool place to come and hang out bowl watch shows (lineup is diverse with some pretty big names) anyway I'd recommend it for sure and I'll definitely be back (which says a lot bc locals don't hit up the strip too often).</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>No frills.  Nothing fancy.  Just some honest burritos and tacos.  Voted "best taco" by New Times a few years back (in the 90's).  Not sure I agree, but they consistently satisfy.  They make a hearty breakfast burrito too.  If you're looking for Sonoran or Tex-Mex or anything beyond what you might find at Filiberto's, try somewhere else.  The red burro combo is my personal favorite.  It's saucy (enchilada style) and just spicy enough.  Bottled beer available.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>First visit to this brand new China a Go Go in Henderson.  I have been to several others and this one is even better.  This one has an expanded menu which includes Chinese and Japanese dishes.  I ordered my usual Mongolian Beef and ordered beef brocoli for my son.  I was ordering to go.  They provided the meals in really nice tupperware type containers rather than the usual foam containers.  The food was delicious and there was so much it will probably last me 2-3 meals.  They provided a good number of hot peppers in mine which was nice because so often I get just 1-2.  They also gave us free eggrolls.  If you like spicy I would highly recommend asking for a side of hot oil, but be careful it is pretty dang hot.  Food was cooked and provided to us in about 5-10 minutes.  Also, the front counter guy was extremely nice and explained the menu and everything to us.  I look forward to coming back and eating in so I can try the soups and some other dishes, but so far very happy with this place and even better that it's the closest to home.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>There is definitely nothing particularly spectacular about Rack Shack BBQ, other than the idea that you can get beef brisket and other smoked meats in an unlikely location -- outside of Phoenix's best small-show venue (The Rhythm Room).  

For that, I appreciate the business minds who are behind the concept, where the same target audience would be satisfied with drab provisions, like hot dogs wrapped in bacon and flimsy-meat burgers.  Instead you can partake in one of the oldest method of preparing meats, either in a full-plate format, or on a seedless hamburger bun.

BBQ from Rack Shack is a great way to kill an hour or so while the opening band clangs through "hits" only groupies would love.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I'll tell you why this was NOT on my top list and why I wont go back to see it ever again...

Blueman group is SO advertised as the coolest show ever, but I didn't think so at all.  The show was slow, nothing spectacular going on, it just seemed reallllllllllllllllllllly slow and boring.  They dont talk so you ave to pay attention---there is a lot of techy stuff going on like neon stuff in the dark and there's some audeience participation but to be honest I didnt like it because there was no real fun stuff going on--except towards the end when they literally toilet paper the audience that's about as exciting as it got for me!

I mean I can't completely knock it--there was some cool stuff here and there but if your like me and aren't into computer techy stuff so much, then dont waste your buck.  I mean honestly I thought the Bellagio would have something better than this, sorry people.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I got an ad under my hotel room door for this pizza delivery place.  What caught my eye was the Chicago Deep Dish pizza.  Now, I don't visit Chicago, so I have only seen mouth-watering pictures of the real thing.  I have tried numerous places that have advertised deep dish pizza, but I've always been disappointed, so I can't believe they represented the real thing (Pizza Hut, anyone?).  But this ad included a pretty impressive picture, so I decided to give it a try.  Well, I am extremely happy!  This is the best pizza I've had in years!  Lots of cheese, sauce, and toppings, and a crust that wasn't super-thick and bready, or fried.  My friend and I could not finish the 12-inch pie we ordered.    If you like your pizza piled high with toppings and a good flavorful sauce, give this place a try!  5 stars for the superb pizza!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Thank God they finally opened one up last year.  I used to have to speed to Barstow to get my hands on my favorite indulgence.  I remember following all the drama on the internet ever since I moved to Vegas.  With the delays and uncertainty it was well worth the wait and the drive from North Las Vegas.  I made excuses to drive all the way down there to St. Rose PKWY but now I end up getting to their second Vegas location more....this one on Boulder HWY.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>For about $7, this buffet is a great deal. Mango nectar and hot chai tea are included with the buffet, a nice touch, and garlic naan is made freshly right to your table. 

The buffet itself consisted of a mix of various popular vegetarian and chicken based dishes. Such items included paneer tikka masala, chicken tikka masala, aloo tikki, chicken vindaloo, aloo gobi, and saag. There's a salad bar with various dressings, and a selection of carrot halwa, gulab jamun, and kheer/rice pudding for dessert. 

My favorite dish out of the buffet items was the aloo gobi. It had a great mix of flavor, and had large chunks of potato and cauliflower. The tikka masala dishes I tried were very heavy on the cream, and had a mild flavor. The chicken vindaloo, normally a very spicy dish, was probably about a medium level of spice.

Service was good. Dishes were taken away promptly and water was refilled as needed.

While other buffets might have more selection and better preparation, Nandini pares down the items to cut down on cost, and includes beverages to add more value for your dollar.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Great food - especially the muffins. They also serve Starbucks coffee along with lunch items like sandwiches and salads.

What is really great about Helpings is that the proceeds support UMOM, a homeless shelter for families. I like that my Starbucks addition can make a difference!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Up there with Crave for a classy bar with good, expensive martinis.  Nice, modern lighting, the atmosphere makes me feel fabulous.....who am I kidding, I am fabulous!  There's always a cute boy around to by me a drink, so the prices don't bother me too much.  Their "one &amp; done" drinks knock my socks off.....heed the warning that the name gives....I'm serious.....brings me back to my jungle juice days at house parties.  5 stars!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>It didn't make me vomit and the waitstaff was okay.  

Actually, the wings were adequate tasting but when they came out they were merely warm.  I'm not sure if they were reheated and sauced or if they were left to sit around for far too long after they were cooked.  

This place is probably full of mall-bar jagoffs on Friday night thanks to their rather large selection of beers.  But we were there at 11 AM Sunday morning because TC Eggington's was ridiculously busy.  Which means that we got everything that was leftover from Saturday night.  Every bit of my food was dehydrated like it was sitting in a fridge overnight, even the lemon in my iced tea.

Needless to say, I was not impressed.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I have been to a few performances in the Royal Lyceum over the last year and enjoy my evenings in this lovely, if slightly cramped, theatre.

The Royal Lyceum is a 658 seat theatre, positioned nicely in the centre of town. It hosts mostly plays and is a principle venue in the International Festival. It's also a major venue for youth theatre. The performances shown are quite varied. They show a lot of classics as well as modern plays (although all tend to have quite modern interpretations). The only problem is that there does seem to often be a hiatus, with not a lot on at times. 

As others have suggested there is a sort of decorative dichotomy. The building is late 19th century but has some modern renovations outside. The interior is more traditional. Inside there are three bars inside the theatre to choose from. Overall I find the building really appealing.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Centotre was one of the first restaurants in Edinburgh that I actually properly noticed giving the experience of eating Italian food a contemporary and trendy edge. There probably are other restaurants in Edinburgh that are Italian, plus modern and fashionable, don't get me wrong, but with Centotre's towering position, housed in a former bank on George Street, it's hard to ignore.

And it shouldn't be ignored, everything about Centotre is worth soaking up, bread and pasta sauce style. I am slightly biased towards anything Italian anyway, but a meal here is always an enjoyable experience, and the spacious booths, nice high ceilings and stylish environment have a part to play in that. Of course, there's no point in sitting in a restaurant just for the scenery, the agenda is high quality Italian food, which is a mix of traditional and contemporary, and whether it's pizza, pasta, or meat dishes you require, Centotre will serve them up in very tasty form. The portions here are generous, so do note this if you're not an eater of large meals, (not a problem for me, it has to be said).</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I have never eaten anything here, although I am aware that the restaurant has some good prices.

Anyway, the only reason that I ever go to the Longhorn is for the $2 blackjack.  The casino is pretty smoky, and there are throngs of weirdos, but there are always open seats at the $2 table.  I honestly don't mind coming here, but I have no reasons to recommend it, either.

The Longhorn is the PERFECT place to gamble if you meet the following qualifications:

-You are by no means a high roller, but you like playing blackjack a couple times a year.

-You smoke a lot (or you don't mind having your clothes stink of smoke).

-You don't feel awkward in the company of incredibly odd people.

-You have no intention of meeting a future life partner that night.

-You live within 2 miles of the place.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Well, if you ignore the meager decor and shitty shitty service, this place rocks!! Lots of food with a great curry sauce.  Last time I ate here with my mom, the lady heling us didn't speak a single word and glared at us the entire time.  The food is too good to pass up though...and the two of us ate there for about $18.....3 stars.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I love eating at Chicago Joe's when I'm in Vegas.  The food is very good, and authentic Italian-American cuisine.  The portions are large, and very tasty!    I have had stuffed pasta, lasagna and fetticine and they were all fantastic.  The prices are reasonable too - I've had italian at several other places in Vegas, but I think the food here is the best for the price.  

The atmosphere is quirky and very 'old Vegas'.  Everytime I'm there, I feel like I'm stepping into the past  and I always imagine Frank Sinatra or some old Gangsters eating there.  It seems like the 'local Italian restaurant', not some pretentious place where the waiter puts the napkin in your lap for you. 

I think it would be an appropriate date spot even though I've never been there on a date. It's dark in there!  We were giggling last February because they still had Christmas decorations up, but it's Vegas, so we couldn't be sure if it was intentional.  The waiters are casual, and not overly friendly, though the last time I was in there our waiter was singing "Strangers in the Night" while he was busing tables, and I really enjoyed his playfulness.   

I recommend Chicago Joe's it if you are hungry for  good italian food and don't want to go to a fancy overpriced place...</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This restaurant is the newest one in the Omelet House chain, a chain that has had restaurants around the Vegas Valley for years. It is at the Boulder/Russell intersection, in the building that previously housed Sizzler.

My mother wanted to try this place so me, her, and my girlfriend went last night. After our experience last night, I would say that eating at this place wasn't exactly a revelation, but I certainly would not be opposed to going back.

The atmosphere in the restaurant is quite good, with a sort of "country kitchen" feel to it, and posters/artwork/etc. of assorted American icons (actors, singers, airplanes, etc.) They even sell some of this sort of stuff at the front counter. My only real complaint with the atmosphere is that, despite the wide, spacious restaurant space, the hostess seemed to insist on seating everyone in the restaurant very close together. Given the lack of customer traffic last night, I wish she had seated us a little further apart.

The menu is HUGE. Like Sizzler that occupied this space before, there is a good-sized salad bar here. As the name of the restaurant implies, the place prides itself on its omelets, and they have tons of options for those. If you're not into salads or omelets though, they have plenty of other choices as well, including pasta and meat dishes. Everything I tried last night was solid, in particular the home-cooked "spud" french fries.  

The service in the restaurant was good. Not the best I have ever had, but definitely solid. At times they were pretty slow refilling my water, but everyone in the restaurant had a positive attitude. However, I did hear a waitress tell another customer who requested some drink on display at the front of the restaurant that they had to get those items from up there, separately, and that there was some policy that wouldn't allow them to serve said items directly to the customers at their dining tables. Don't know what the hell was up with that. 

Still, in the end, this was an excellent dining experience. Not the best I've ever had, but I'll more likely than not end up coming back in the near future.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This Walmart is huge and cheap, like your mama... ha ha ha, just kidding.  But seriously, it's a pretty good place to go when you need to get something and you don't want to spend a lot of money.  The customers can be pretty darn ghetto at this location, but then again, I'm guessing that most Walmarts are built in areas that are more... urban.  I am tempted to give this place two stars, but the deals are so good that it earns an additional star.  Again, go here if you're looking to save a buck on whatever you're getting.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Veggie haggis?!?!?!  But oh so glad that I dared, it was really, really good!

This cafe is situated right off of Princes Street, complete with stone face exterior and is cozy inside.  Granted, the cups of coffee are tiny, but the breakfast special can't be beat.  

I visited a couple of years ago, and the breakfast was priced well for a full Scottish breakfast, with choice of standard haggis, or veggie haggis.   The veggie version was fantabulous!  Spices of bergamont and lavender permeated through this soy based scoop of tastiness, I would love to go back to Edinburgh (again, I do love this city), and stop by here again for breakfast.  Tasty, tasty!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>As a San Diego native, I have frequented Arrivederci Cucina Italiana in both Hillcrest and near my Ranch San Diego home. I was so happy to see that they have followed me to Fountain Hills. I'm sorry, but Fountain Hills restaurants are not very good in general...until now.

Arrivederci is such a quality establishment and the food is so very fresh. My wife and I ordered the steak and mushroom risotto. Risotto is hard to nail but they do it to perfection. The risotto is creamy and filled with a variety of fresh mushrooms. The steaks were cooked as ordered and to perfection. They were so tender that I could cut mine with my fork. They were also seasoned perfectly.The meals came with a variety of fresh-baked bread and a fresh pesto dipping sauce. Considering the portions and the quality of meat, the prices are very reasonable.

The owner is so very kind and makes you feel like you are part of the family. Needless to say, we will be coming here often. 

Finally...a REAL restaurant experience in Fountain Hills!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Diggin' this pool area. In the heart of downtown with just enough party and just enough relaxation. The drinks are cheap and the scenery is pretty good for an old(er) dude like me, where all the girls are almost attainable. I mean, when you go to all the other super hip pools with all the cool kids, the beer belly just ain't a selling point - it will fly here. Leave your six packs at home.

As I mentioned, the drinks are surprisingly affordable for a Vegas pool, but you do need to remember that you are a bit off the beaten path when it comes to LV. There was a DJ playing but it was simply to keep the mood of the pool going rather than it being the main draw of the crowd. They didn't charge us a cover and in all honesty I don't think we were supposed to be there since we weren't hotel guests. The security guards were nice enough to let us take in a couple of quick cocktails and peep the place out since I think it was clear that we weren't going to make a day out of it. 

Friendly staff and a cheap Vegas drink is a win in my book. See you soon, Picnic.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Food's not bad here, better than a so so diner I'd say.

What can't be beat are their 24/7 specials like prime rib dinner for $7.99 or filet mignon - surf and turf for $9.99.  They also have grave yard specials like two eggs, hash brown and bacon w/toast for $1.99 or  pancakes w/bacon or sausage for $1.99.

I had the prime rib dinner that came w/soup or salad, dinner rolls, baked or mashed potato and vegetables.  Not a bad deal at all.  The rolls were actually really yummy, but they had the super market baked taste.  I chose soup - chicken noodle that came in a cup the size of a large tea cup.  The salad was standard - ice berg lettuce.  My steak was a really good size.  Not the best prime rib of course, a little over done.. not cooked too properly, but still good.  Came w/tons of butter, au jus sauce and horse radish.  Can't beat that!

The breakfast special was good too, I had the pancakes w/sausage and the pancakes were enormous and fluffy!

The menu items are standard american fare but they also had an entire page of asian food! I could only wonder how they tasted.

What I like are also the small things they include, like the fries w/your burger comes in a small little deep fryer net, cute.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Brand new place. Ordered the burger and sp fries. Burger was fantastic, fries were sparse and a little under cooked, but the burger more than made up for it. Great happy hour specials like a 22 oz draft for $3 and long happy hours. Even better than PTs. Nice looking place, plenty of tvs. The bartender was friendly and attentive. I'll be back.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Spicy hot is a very subjective thing. Arriba's dishes are made with Hatch chilis from New Mexico. For the lightweights, they have a heat scale next to the chili items. They can't make their food too hot  for me. Everything I've had here has been good. Service is usually good, but have had a couple of issues with the service in the past. I've been to the Chandler and Scottsdale locations.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This friendly little neighborhood bar has cheap drinks, karaoke on the weekends, darts, pool tables and Big Buck Hunter to keep you entertained. It's small inside, but nonetheless inviting and the people there are a good mix of locals, both young and old. Karaoke is on Friday and Saturday nights and has a small rotation so you can sing a lot of songs. Drinks are cheap and you can drink for an entire evening for less than $20. 

I think one of the memorable things about this place is that they have a toy crane machine that you can win porn from...definitely a place with some character!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Pretty average restaurant.  It smells like an old person dinner club, very ketchupy and fried-foody.  Waitstaff is very nice and personable.  
The roasted vegetable and hummus wrap is amazing.  I wouldn't go downtown and deal with parking just for the sandwich, but if I was staying at the hotel or I lived in the neighborhood, I would head over there occasionally just for the sandwich.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>It's a Burger King.  My expectations were not that high.  However, they are unbearably slow, and the dining area is usually pretty dirty.  The food is mediocre, even for fast foot's low standards.  The staff usually acts like you're ruining their day for showing up.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is McDonalds!!! Nothing good to expect!

Dont wanna lie so here's a honest Review.

McDonalds has many stores but the quality of their food is low. Quantity over Quality!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is a cool venue to catch a show. I actually played a show here and it was good times. They have a large dance floor or an area where people can gather to watch performers. They also have a nice sized Bar which can handle a good sized crowd. We all know that is a must when it comes getting a drink in a crowed venue. I really enjoyed this spot and had a fun time rocking peoples face off!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>After taking multiple trips to Italy the last few years, I have been desperately searching for an authentic, high-quality pizza in the states. One of my friends suggested I head across town to try Novencento and I wasn't disappointed. I'm SO HAPPY a location has now opened on the Southwest side of town.

The major draw here is the quality of the ingredients. Super high quality dough, olive oil, salami and cheese makes the pizza superior to other pizzas. This is true European / Italian style pizza. Pizza Hut it ain't. I decided on a custom built pizza. You can add  really high quality toppings to customize, but they suggest you add no more than 3. The pizza won't cook all the way through if it's loaded down, so don't start fussing that your pie isn't loaded with cheese or salami -- it's done in the traditional Italian way! 

The pizza itself was tasty. I opted for a simple cheese, marinara, and olive oil pie. Sometimes you can tell the true quality of a meal when you go for simple and unfussy. I cannot stress the super high quality of the ingredients that are used. They also offer three different kinds of pizza crust: wheat, original and gluten free (perfect if you have food allergies).  The caesar salad was very good and the smaller size makes a nice side dish for one. To keep with the Italian theme, they have a small gelato counter and they serve Illy coffee (my favorite), so I'll be sure to get an espresso next time I'm in. There's a Starbucks directly across the way from them but if you go there to get a coffee instead of here, line up so I can give you a smack! Illy espresso is the BEST.

The atmosphere is cool and hip with concrete floors and gorgeous reclaimed wood tables. They have a soda fountain with brewed iced tea and Pepsi products. The employees are all VERY friendly and welcoming and they are happy to take the time to teach you about the menu. Note that parking in this shopping center can be difficult -- it's sometimes hard to find a spot. This is a great, fresh pizza place! Welcome to the neighborhood, Novecento!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Preface:
OK, to start off... I am a hot dog snob. Growing up in Northwest Indiana, I made it up to Chicago quite a few times and many of those times I got a hot dog (The Wiener Circle/Char-Dogs is by far my fav) Also, I am a HUGE White Castle fan and cannot stand living off the frozen sliders I have to buy in SoCal (I even attempted to make my own homemade White Castle sliders... and failed).

The Food:
As my parents live right down the street, I drove by this place and had to try the authentic chicago style dog. So one night my gf and buddy drove down and placed a to go order for ourselves and parents at home. My parents had steamed hot dogs, I ordered a char cheese dog and cheese fries, my gf had the polish and my buddy had the italian beef. We also ordered 4 of "Bob's Sliders" which he references to White Castle on the menu.

The dogs and polish were all awesome. They had that real vienna beef taste and snap. They also used the steamed buns with the black seeds on them which made it. The cheese sauce on my dog was plentiful and tasty. Altho not as bomb as Char-Dogs in ChiTown, it was pretty damn tasty. I ordered my dog Charred (you can also order it steamed) but I dont think it was charred, although it would be hard to tell with all the cheese. The cheese fries were also good, homemade fries, a little darker than your usual fry, and covered in cheese. I couldve asked for just a bit more cheese sauce, and a little crispier fries (these were a little soggy with the cheese sauce, but I also took them to go so I dont know if theyd be crispier in store). The slider was good... for a burger. It was tasty, however it was NO WHITE CASTLE. No resemblance at all except for a smaller bun. Oh ya, and when you order a soft drink, dont expect Pepsi or Coke... Bob has RC cola streamin here!

Service:
I assume the guy that took my order was Bob and the owner. Real nice guy, obviously from Chicago. I ordered ketchup on my dads dog and he was offended and joking with me. He was all over the shop talkin to the other couple that was eating there. Really nice guy. He took the order but did not make the food, there was another guy doin the cookin. I think he was new, because this is why my review gets a 4 rather than a 5. As we walked in, the other couple ordered fried chicken (which looked awesome). They ended up takin it back to be cooked longer. I saw it, didnt look pink or anything, but they wanted it more cooked I guess. As for our order, we placed an order for 2 cheese sliders and 2 jalapeno cheese sliders. We ended up getting all 4 jalapeno cheese sliders. Not too big of a deal. Also, as mentioned above, Im pretty sure my dog was no charred but steamed (opposite of what I ordered). It was still good. The one thing that my roommate wouldnt shut up about... he never got his peppers with his italian beef. We didnt check before we left, but he said that the peppers really make the sandwich, so he was a little pissed about that.

Conclusion:
Overall everyone liked the food. Next time I go, I will prob order 2 cheese char dogs and maybe fries (but the dogs are where its at). I would probably eat there and double check the order. Im sure the cook was new as is the restaurant and everything tasted bomb. The decor is fun and chicago-y and the owner is genuine and nice. Id def recommend eatin here!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I'm a basic dog fan - ketchup and onions and nothing else.  Let's the dog taste come through.  Don Guido's has been consistently tasty on numerous visits.  OK, it's a hot dog... not much to screw up... but it's tasty, hot, not overcooked.  Onion rings and fries are both good.  I always leave full and happy, an the service is very friendly. If only they were open later in the evening, I'd be there more often (they close at 5 or 5:30 on weekdays and at 3:00 weekends).</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The Hebrides Bar is exactly what you would expect from a train-station local....very localised! The punters all knew each other when I came in for a quick tipple with my mum before going to London, and we were met with silence and watched until we had taken our seat. There was no effort to make us feel welcome, or even comfortable.

Upon speaking to my friends about Hebrides bar, they were surprised as they have had really good experiences in the bar - at the weekend and late at night! I'm planning on going back at the weekend to see if it will change my mind....but I don't have high hopes</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Such a great venue that includes 16 bowling lanes, a restaurant, a stage with dance floor &amp; plenty of bars to keep you hydrated. 

Bowling is $60 a hour for a lane &amp; shoe rentals for up to 8 people. Be sure to try to snag an lane on the second floor because it comes with your own private box on the balcony that overlooks the stage &amp; dance floor! Really is the best seat in the house. 

Food is phenomenal as well. I personally loved the french bread pizza, corn on the cob &amp; the alcoholic milkshake. DO NOT leave without tasting the milkshake! Literally the best milkshake I have ever had. 

I have already bought tickets to come back for another show!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>YAY Mounds!!
I've gone with my sister to get kitty litter and food here before and I really like this place! 
For any Chicagoan's who may read this, it is similar to a Petco, but priced like a PetsMart. So they are rather pricey..
My favorite thing about this store was the Adoption Center. They have this great big glass window that you can see all the available kitties they have up for adoption. And they also have a board with pictures and descriptions of available dogs from the local shelters they can bring in. I know PetsMart offers this as well, but it is not nearly as big or clean. :)~</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I beg to differ.  Had a very nice experience here.  I had the sea bass-- fresh herbs and lemon, nicely done.  Husband asked for a dish not on the menu and it was prepared just as he asked.  Also a nice panna cotta with good texture.  And good espresso.  Friendly service as well.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Dull as Starbucks can be, when it comes to this branch it's location. location, location that does it for me. Nicholson Street is one of the more interesting areas just off the city centre. With local immigrant communities, students and some shifter local characters in the melting pot, it's got a fantastic buzz and bustling atmosphere.

It's a bit poky, but there's no better place in town to have an apple and cinammon donut thing, a coffee, and stare out into the wilderness.</review:review_text>

Came up with this flavor driven tastebud amusement park for My belly!!!! 

Any way you try it. Any thing you place on it.  Your not going to regret it. Well if you eat too many in one sitting you might .,, uh yea just trust me on that. 

Great service. Friendly staff. Always smiling and working hard. They love to help you with fun pairings and recommendations! 

They have all kinds of dogs.

    <review:review_text>This is truly a must see, I agree.  Such amazing voice and dance talents that perform throughout the night.  And of course you have to see the beautiful Holly Madison.  

Doesn't look like much from the outside, but once you step in and see the band tucked away within the wall, you know you are somewhere special.  

Go order yourself a pisco sour and have a good time.  This will be a hot spot on the strip in no time.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Another great Vegas dive bar with the cheapest well drinks we've found ($2.25 for Christian Bros. brandy and soda).  If you like country, karaoke on Friday is good.  Friendly people behind and in front of the bar.  We always stop here when we're in town!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>You get a loud welcome from the girls when you walk in. The restaurant is covered in animal heads, antlers and tvs. Our server was Julia. She was very nice and attentive.  All the servers are pretty cute, fit, and young. 

My bf ordered the chicken strips.  She asked what sauce, so our friend said honey mustard, my bf and I said ranch at the same time.  I pulled her aside and said we could just share one ranch.  I also ordered ONE pretzel.  Our order was brought back and we got 2 pretzels and also 2 ranch(there is a charge per ranch).  I asked about the pretzel, they were willing to take it back. However, the boys agreed to eat it.  The food wasn't bad, typical bar food.  Actually better food than the restaurant most adjacent.  Our friend joined the table much later. Very quickly our server came to ask what he would like to drink. Good job! 
My bf ordered another small beer but then she brought back the large one.  We never had to wait on our service, but she did not always get it right. 

They offer a fun 4 person shot on a ski. Chanting, "shotski! Shotski! Shotski!"  At some point some hip hop music was blasting loud on the speakers during the shot ski. (The speakers were LOUD) 

This spot is like a hooters but with mid drifts.   I think this location is more attractive than the one on the strip.  Will for sure be a hang out for us close to home.  I'd say generously 3 stars for food.  And an extra one for the experience the boys enjoyed the atmosphere.  Wish the girls stopped by our table more, I feel like since I'm a girl maybe they didn't want to?</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>So there I was, with a soaking wet tent and on my way to the National Mustard Museum. But hey, hard-core mustard fan as I am, I know better 
than to start the day with all-you-can-sample-mustard, right?

So the BF and I surfed Yelp to find a decent breakfast stop and Lo, right down the street from our campground was C's, so we figured we'd stop in.

Now, it was Father's Day, which we realized when we walked in, cause the place was packed. 

It's pretty much your standard breakfast food, with some specialty bakery fare. Clean, tasty and fairly reasonably priced. It is not a huge place either, but there was PLENTY of waitstaff to keep things moving. 

I had the skillet breakfast, which I was very pleased to find had the option of turkey. (This made me happy, as I like meat at breakfast after a night of rainy camping, but am allergic to pork.) The skillet had turkey, potatoes, onions and green peppers mixed together, with toast and 2 eggs on top. The eggs were perfect, which impressed me, given how crazy busy the place was. I do have one complaint about my food 'tho, the onions, peppers and potatoes were not cooked enough for my taste. In fact, the onions were damn near raw. Luckily, they were finely shredded, so it wasn't too bad, but I take away a star for that .

(BF says his potatoes were underdone too. Not raw, but not quite done enough.)

Waitstaff was very good about keeping coffee filled. And, since it was a bakery, we HAD to at least try a cinnamon roll.  It was a good roll, and they even warmed it up for us. 

I noticed that they had a LOT of baked goods specializing with Strawberry and Rhubarb, which is in season right now. To me that's a good thing, even though I'm not big on rhubarb. Tends to indicate a reliance on seasonal (and hopefully locally grown) produce. 

It being Father's day, they had a special on Steak and Eggs and a fresh berry topped waffle special too. Dads got a HUGE complimentary chocolate-covered strawberry, which I thought was nice.   

Oh yeah, the eggs with Hollendaise sauce looked and smelled really good...</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I lived in Coronado for several years and my family and I frequented this place a lot. The owners know my dad pretty well, and they are always super friendly to my brother and I. They have a pretty decent wine selection now, since the neighborhood began to show interest in it. They carry all the norms as far as snacks go, but then they have their selection of foods you might need but don't want to go all the way to the grocery store to get. They also have hot pickles that I crave on a regular basis. 

I don't live in the neighborhood anymore so I don't come here as often, but for the locals it's a must. Or even if you're in the area.....</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Sorry Mr. Matthew But i had to go inside to order. And i agree with you on the Nastyness. Didnt see the old man there sleeping but it was a mess in there. 
But they make up for the great tasty food. I got the Sweet and Sour chicken dinner combination. With that i got a WonTon soup and some BBQ pork ribs, all was tasty and good. I got a menu to go so ill be ordering delivery next time and it will be soon. Ill be trying out some of their other items too. 
By the way there is a .30 cent charge if you use your credit or debit.

    <review:review_text>Went in to Firehouse subs today for lunch 6/3/14 and did not have a great experience.    There was a female manager running around scolding employees telling them where to stand and where not too.  She verbally reprimanded a person on the line for making a sandwich incorrectly (all within my earshot).  While she should have been worried about why it is taking 10-15 minutes for me to get my 1 sub.  

Now onto the sub.. I got an italian sandwich, which had some kind of sweet sauce on it.  I cannot fathom why there would be a sweet sauce (think sweet mayo) on a italian sandwich.

Overall, really disappointed, will not be back.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Jamba juice would be the happist place on earth but for two problems:

1.) The sound of six blenders working in overdrive simultaneously makes my brain bleed and,

2.) The Bunny Ranch is the happiest place on earth. 

As JJ's go, this one is typically clean and staffed with the typical compliment of perky teen-agers all reeking of over-ripe fruit.   Is it expensive for a smoothie?  Hell yeah.  Is it probably out of your way in the morning? Yeah (unless you're a poor shmuck and work at the McDonalds next door).  Are you going to make smoothies on your own using  4 different fruits and orange sherbert complete with nebulously defined "boosts?"  

Fuck no.   

Drop the $5 and get a smoothie from Jamba.   Jambo means hello, but Jamba means corporate health-craze capitalism.  Hip, Hip.....hooray.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I stopped by here while doing some work downtown and really liked it. I love having outdoor options for eating, drinking and people watching. There is also seating indoors.

The food options are mainly dogs and pizza. My husband and I each had a dog, mine was with jalapenos, fried onions and a spicy sauce. Very tasty, fresh toppings, good buns. There were several interesting selections or you could build your own. The food was a little slow. There was a great beer selection on tap. When our choice was taking a little long to pour the waitress gave us each a little sample of another beer while we waited which was very nice. Service was friendly.

My one complaint would be there should be an option of potato salad to go with beer and dogs.

They were setting up for a band when we were leaving which I would have enjoyed watching if I didn't have work t get to.  I think this place is a good addition to downtown.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is our first time eating here. When we arrived during lunch we were seated immediately. Our drinks were promptly ordered and brought to us. We ordered spinach artichoke dip it was delicious and filling. Our server seemed very nice but sort of spacey but overall very pleasant. We sat in the bar so it was a little noisy but not too bad. We ordered the classic chicken tenders with half rack of ribs our sides were Mac and cheese and butted corn. These all were amazing. The Texas margarita was huge and only $4. They didn't skimp on the alcohol either. Overall this place was great. Will be returning again.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Relax everybody. Its not an actual factory. It's equivalent to the M and M's store across the street. Located inside the New York New York Casino towards the strip, it is two floors of all things Hershey.

Things like Twizzlers, Reese's Pieces, Jolly Ranchers, and of course, Kisses just to name a few. If you ask me, the first floor has all the good stuff. In a glass case they have a bunch of different pastries and goodies like chocolate covered rice krispies treats on a stick.

Of course I cant forget to mention that as soon as you enter on the first floor, they give you free chocolate samples ranging from Kisses and Mini Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, to Mini Hershey Dark Chocolate squares.

From my first initial visit, this was only the soft opening. The grand opening is on Tuesday, June 3rd 2014. I asked the lady at the register if there were gonna be any grand opening specials. She said she didnt know. That was kind of lame. No buy one, get one or free grab bags with purchase. Nothing.

So in closing, I recommend you start off on the first floor, get your free sample, and then go straight to the goodies case. Then, if you get bored or are into Jolly Ranchers, go to the second floor. Oh, and if you are into any kind of bling, they have that every where in the form of pillows and shirts. Lastly, remember you're on the strip so dont be shocked if everything seems overpriced.

    <review:review_text>Truffles n bacon is an exceptional cafe. Although the place is somewhat hidden , it is worth the trip.  I attended the grand opening and  I was expecting decent food but the their signature burger is above expectations. The place also has  diverse assortments such as  salads,  Mac and cheese,  grilled cheese sandwhichs, deserts, and my favorite, bacon jam. Overalll, Trufflesnbacon is a must.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Fantastic take out spot. A great take out spot for a quick bit of thin crust or call a head and get a great deep dish pizza. It is a rare pizza place that dishes out a deep dish pie, and Pizza Chicago puts together a great sausage, mushroom and onion pie that's thick with sauce and cheese. the crust is a light cornmeal dough that is crisp and moist on the inside. We will definitely be ordering again. The wait of 45 minutes is worth it. I think I might call right now!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Stopped on Valentines Day and was greeted in a very nice way by enthused staff.  Ordered latte, extra hot with minimal foam.  Made perfectly!  Parking and entry was easy approaching from the west.  They have a drive thru which I will try next week.  Latte was good, coffee of high quality.  Prices reasonable and got one dollar off for VDay!  Thanks guys!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Best customer service! Every time I visit this place they always make me feel welcome.  I always get something new and never off the menu.  I am a huge fan of coffee and they have the best.  "Surprise me." Is what I always say and they have never given me something I didn't like.  They always have great deals. Will be my regular place!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I am not a fan of KFC. Not at all.

However, I do love their spicy chicken wings. I wish they weren't so freaking expensive. Oh and I do like their cole slaw.

We went through the drive-thru and we had to wait for our food. My husband happened to go inside because he was thirsty and wanted a drink.

Turns out they had set our food on the counter and no one was bringing it out and my husband just had a sneaky suspicion that it was ours, so he asked and what do you know? 

At least it was still piping hot.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Maybe it's because we were frequent visitors, but I've always pretty good service here.  Between our trips to the bar, for sit down food, and take out food - it could make sence that they knew who we were.  I worked right in that area and we enjoyed that we could just walk over there for lunch.  It also served as a great after work spot that everyone could agree on.  

I know, I know, chains are evil... but there is a lot to be said for a spot that you can take a vegetarian, a burger and beer girl, a Martini girl, a "get the party started pre-strip club" kind of guy, a few sports nuts who'll go anywhere as long as the game is on, and some folks who just want food - and they can all find something they like.  

Finally - when we said "hey, we're here for lunch so we have to go kinda fast" they would always hustle to get us out on time.  So is it my spot of choice, heck no.  But it's not a bad default option.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The service is good, which is why it deserves 2 stars, but as far as food and subs go, you're going to want to go somewhere else. I've been here twice and both subs were abysmal. I can't remember exactly what it was but it was a thin with roast beef. Basically $4 for some dense chewy bread with 1 slice of meat. It would have been $5 with 1 slice of cheese. The second time i ordered a different sub but it was still small and tasteless. Besides service, the only other nice thing about here is that their ingredients are always fresh and they bake their own bread ( I mean the bread sucks but at least it's baked in store).</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I will be the first to admit that I was one Of the many residence of the Grand View neighborhood who was against the grocery store opening. That being said I am pleasantly surprised with Metro Market and they've changed my mind about the store being apart of the neighborhood. 


The Metro Market is the perfect size for the area. It's not too large to where it takes away from the natural beauty of the neighborhood and for the most park, traffic has remind fairly calm. 

The ideal way to describe the grocery store is to say its a combination of Hy Vee and Copps. The have a very large selection of wines, liquor and offers a variety of fresh items including a deli, sushi stand, cooked BBQ, desserts and pastries and more. I love looking at their cakes. They are super colorful and very reasonably priced.

I definitely see myself coming here to pick up small items say for a special occasion like a BBQ or birthday. However, I am not sure if they are a store where you can grocery shop for a large family. I noticed some items they sale are also sold at places like Costco and there is a difference of prices. You would be spending a few bucks more at the Metro Market for some of their wines and sea pak items like the shrimp scampi than Woodmans which is why I believe they are a good place to pick up items versus shopping. 

Overall, the store is very nicely designed. The employees were great.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Tried this place since it was on my way to the hotel. They are brand new to Mesa. They have an impressive list of sandwiches. They have a lo g list of veggie sandwiches, if that is your preference.I ordered the "Michael Jordan" - a meatball sandwich. It was outstanding! One of the best meatball sandos I have had. The place itself is bright, clean and welcoming. The staff was friendly and helpful. I would certainly go again, and I highly recommend the place.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Looking for a new donut shop in Mesa? Look no further! Dutch Donut Factory makes donuts fresh in house and boy does it smell delicious when you walk in the door!

Their large case is filled with tons of donuts - you're guaranteed to find at least one (or 10) that you'll love! 

Not only do they have donuts they have a ham and cheese stuffed croissant - which are huge!

I tried the maple glazed, blueberry cake, apple fritter and toasted coconut cream filled - all of which were fresh! The maple glaze was so tasty and the blueberry cake was not overly sweet - they perfect donut if you're not a frosting fan.

I also order a Very Berry smoothy. It was made with whole fruits not a pre-made purée. It was smooth not icy - a great treat on a hot summer day

Dutch also has coffees, slush and Gelato!! 

Please give this great family owned shop a try - they owner Vee is a total sweetheart and put her heart into each donut she makes herself!!

Great addition to this strip mall :)</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Great German food here. Nice selection of beers. The waiter was very informative and answered all of our questions. We tried the Vienna Style Schnitzel and the Pretzel Dumplings with Mushroom Sauce. Both were delicious! We especially enjoyed the fried potatoes with the schnitzel. The apple strudel was great for dessert. One suggestion is to have suggested beer pairings with the entrees.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Attention Vegas locals!!! If you are looking for a great hidden gem, this is a great place. It features old Las Vegas decor and a retro lounge atmosphere. The staff is really friendly and Hooligans even offers a points card if you are a gambler. Come and watch your favorite sports here, too! Their selection of food is fantastic for a bar. I had chicken and waffles that were really good. I don't know too many bars that offer Meatloaf or Hawaiian Kalua Pork but this one does. 

Bring a group of friends, you won't regret it.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We received a coupon in the mail for a free meal with the purchase of another meal, so we decided to have breakfast this past Sunday morning at IHOP. Despite living near this IHOP for 2 years, I have never eaten here, mainly because there are other places nearby that I prefer for breakfast. 

IHOP is currently doing an all-you-can-eat pancake promo, my husband got that with eggs and hashbrowns. I decided to get the International Crepe Passport with strawberry banana crepes, this came with eggs, bacon and sausage. 

Our waiter was efficient and helpful. He made sure to bring out a pot of coffee so we wouldn't have to pester him for refills, as well as Tabasco and ketchup in case we needed it. 

Our food was good,  not great but good. The crepes were particularly tasty, I wish they did an all-you-can-eat crepe promo. I still prefer Omelet House down the street though. Unless we have a coupon, we probably won't be back for a while...</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Located inside and upstairs this place recalls the glory days of college dining halls.

Ugh... I think my omelet stayed with me all day. Something like 15 hours of energy from the grease of gross of my omelet... Blech.

3.49 cent strajk and eggs, if you're a member of the rewards club...
Otherwise its 7.99.

Skip it....</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place is your standard pub atmosphere. kinda dark. If you enter on your left you enter the bar. IF you enter on the right it is the restaurant. I myself have yet to enter on the right hand side. My bf and I came here when we had 2 NFL games to watch. I ordered the buffalo wings eventhough I was dying to try the hamburger b/c I saw another person who had just received their order @ the bar. The wings were good but not to die for or anything. Well since we had been there since 10 am... and here it was 4 and we were still there watching our games we just went ahead and ordered dinner. I ordered the cheeseburger and it was really really good. 
On acouple of other occasions we came here for HH. well it wasnt so happy b/c the prices were kinda high compared to other bars in the area (for mixed drinks @ least for happy hour prices. I dont think I'd come back here for just happy hour but I would come back for that cheeseburger or the wings. ..but its just hard to come here for wings when BWW is just 5 min. away.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>did a group thing here last night - about 40 people sharing in some chicago style pizza then we're off to a ny place next week.  

I have to preface my review with the comment that i really don't like chicago style pizza - as in the pie-style, i actually like their thin-crust pizzas.  

we try some bread, salads, rigatoni with sauce, sausage w/peppers and onions  pizza - both thick and thin.  the highlights - the sausage pepper and onions and the thin crust meatlovers.  i thought the thick was kinda thin ( and yes, i've eaten at 3 different  places in chi-town, including uno ) - my one pet peeve , i thought their sauce was too sweet.

overall, it ain't a bad place and i can see myself dropping by to get some sausage, peppers and onions to go.  As to the chicago motif - except for a poster of an early 90's oprah, no one from the 21st century - about time they make space for our newest President !</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>My favorite lunch spot on the Vegas strip!
I come here once a week during my stay.

Easy to book, friendly&amp;quick service, beautiful interior overlooking the Aria.

The best part, of course, is the delicious seafood.
(Disclosure: I am a meat lover. But I do cave into fish only if it's really, really good)

The dishes are simply prepared seasoned only with olive oil/salt/herbs/capers that highlight the quality and freshness of the ingredients.

I've only ever been here for lunch and their lunch menu is perfect. For just $22, you can choose from 3 courses of healthy, perfectly portioned dishes. I LOVE that you can leave without feeling overly stuffed. For those who like octopus, this appetizer is a must try. Otherwise the crab cake is amazing as well. 

Of course, you can choose from the dinner menu during lunch as well. When I do, I always get the fresh fish they recommend and the tuna sashimi-style appetizer. All of their fish are served de-boned, a huge plus.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The D&amp;D has a great selection of sandwhiches... unless you're a veg... and then the selection is pretty limited.... although admittedly, I have never asked for the apple and brie sandwich WITHOUT the turkey to see if they will make it for me.  I bet it would be good.  I make a mean brie and pear panini at home.  

The veggie sandwich is pretty good.   

The place is pretty good for escaping a bad day.  You can sit upstairs with your sandwich and a book and sip iced tea until you're ready to go out and face the world again.  I also went on a pretty reasonable date there once.  We sat outside on the upper porch and talked until the place was closing.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>An interesting place, where burgers are available in a number of sizes, all of which are pretty big! The food is very good quality, and the lady who runs the place knows her stuff.


 It's quite cosy inside, but very small, so you're probably best to book to make sure you can get a seat.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Very nice presentation and plating. High end tasting food at about 10 per plate. Relaxed atmosphere, great soda machines and very clean feeling. It's worth the trip. Only complaint is a slow line to order and the digital menus are small print and hard to read. Great place. Give it a try.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>So I went here yesterday to return an item I was not able to use and since I did not have the receipt I was issued a gift card. 

I decided to use the gift card immediately so I wouldn't have to drive back but when I went to check out the register would not take the gift card. The asst. mgr then calls their customer servicw and I was told that the gift card was in their system but since I  barely got the card it was not active. 

I was then advised to return and use it later. I dont go to this store often so returning would not be convenient.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Beets is a posh food shop filled with nice and wholesome things that you could probably find a lot cheaper somewhere else.  Things like unusual herbal teas, almond milk, and alfalfa beansprouts that can be tasty and are undoubtedly very healthy, yet you slightly suspect that people buy them more as status symbols to prove their membership of the green bourgeoisie than because they actually like them.  If organic-loving celebs like Gwyneth Paltrow, Madonna and their ilk lived in Edinburgh, I'm sure this is the kid of place they would shop.

Don't get me wrong, I'm a fully-signed up, tofu munching, lentil loving vegetarian myself, so in theory Beets should be right up my street.  It's just that, on the spectrum of health food shops, it's much more yuppie than hippie, which makes me feel slightly uncomfortable.  Actually when I say uncomfortable I probably just mean poor.

What did impress me, like other reviewers, was their awesome range of fancy beer, such as Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and Brooklyn IPA, which aren't easy to track down.  Those, in my opinion, are worth forking out for, and definitely justify a visit to this upmarket shop.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I'm actually surprised by the previous reviews based on our experience.  We were a party of 7 and none of us had anything really good to say about the place.  It's true, they have real grass.  Otherwise, it was uncomfortable, service was slow, and the band was REALLY bad.   It was too loud and the Amp crackled making the singer's voice even worse than it actually was. The staff seemed disorganized.  I wanted a glass of wine, and my choice was one red wine and based on how long it took us to just get drinks, we were concerned that we wouldn't get or food in time to catch our show after. There was no "people watching" from this vantage point, although, passers-by were able to lean against the fence from main street and watch us.  My German Brat wasn't bad, but I there are definitely better ones out there and I wouldn't go out of my way to go to the Bier Garten again, not with so many other choices.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>One of our first restaurant visits when we moved here.  We have since learned to avoid any restaurant a local recommends.  Menu was full of bland comfort food.  Wife had chicken and dumplings that tasted like they came out of a can  My steak was tough and flavorless.  Restaurant has been in the same location for about 100 years and it shows, it's badly in need of a remodel.  Entire place smelled like vomit and was dirty.  I could smell the bathrooms ten feet away and when I had to visit they were even worse, layer over layer of dirt.  Where's the health inspector.  Service was extremely poor, especially considering we were the only people in the place.  I guess the highschooler that was serving us was too busy talking on her cell phone to help us.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>For anyone living in the Mountains Edge/Blue Diamond area, this is a great location to pick up anything you may need to "wet 'yer whistle" when I last went to a house party I was in charge of bringing the mixers and Bevmos were closed and there's not really juice options at gas stations so I found this gem. Wide selection of wines, beers, premixed, along with snacks.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Function Juicery is awesome!  Right down the street from my gym and I'm able to stop in at least 2-3 times a week since they've opened.  Been trying to taste all the different blends and so far my favorites are the 2 with Beets in them.  I think STIMULATE, and umm... I forget the second.  you can't miss them because the beet juice makes them blood red.

My wife is thinking about doing their cleanse.  6-7 juices day and its like  a reset on your body.  Even the green juices that are mostly veggies are good.  They use some interesting plant mixtures to "spice" up the flavor so it doesn't feel like your drinking thick smelly juice like when i've tried to juice at home.  Let the professionals do it for you.  It tastes better!!!

Cute little cafe feel with some reclaimed wood on the walls and even an indoor lawn for you to chill on.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The Doric is apparently "Edinburgh's oldest gastro pub", and it sells its legacy to the local tourists. Within, it's a nice warm tavern, complete with ales aplenty and stodgy food on the menu.

It's always been quiet enough when I've visited but that's usually when I'm waiting on an early evening train. I'm unsure what this place is like at the weekend but I can imagine it being a lot busier, with functions and whatnot. Seems to attract an older crowd who seek out its own brand of peace and quiet.

They offer homemade pies, Sunday roasts, 2 courses for a tenner, and the food is good nosh. Along with catering for my gastro belly, they have a couple of pasta dishes available on their A la Carte menu which will be suitable for vegetarians.

Traditional in a modern, pub grub kind of way and certainly more serene than the sometimes uptight Edinburgh cocktail scene, the Doric is great for a meal and a catch up over a few cold ones.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I have been to Squeeze once, and my initial impression is that it's something that will work well in the Linq strip of shops and eateries. You can get fresh squeezed juices and smoothies made from fresh fruits and vegetables while you wait.. and to many of them you can add a little bit of booze if you like. ...from my perspective, it's just a little bit of booze. 

I really like the concept of this place, though.. and they also offer gluten free products including baked items and sandwiches. That's a nice feature that people think they want these days. All sandwiches and salads and whatnot that I noticed were $8+ before tax. All 4 drinks we ordered were $14 each . that's allot for cocktails and juices, even on the strip. 

That included a small green smoothie I ordered called  "the cleanse," to which I had Hendricks Cucumber Gin added.. it was good... But pricey for what it was. Green tasting, lots of un-pureed bits.. which I actually didn't mind at first, but then chewing my drink became interfering of actually drinking the smoothie. Tons of ice too.. so it was a little watered  down tasting. 

I actually give it 3.5 stars, because the concept is good and I think it'll do descent business, being located where it is. However, $14 is waaaay too much for a smoothie that's 12-16 oz. .. and honestly I think the recipes need some tweaking. 

I'll be back to check it out again soon, I'm sure! Happy Eating to you !</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Just opened in the Scottsdale Quarter! Excellent! Don't miss the truffle fries and/or the zucchini fries, plenty to share one order and they are on the happy hour menu! Had the Ahi Tuna salad, great and the Breakfast Burger, swapped out American for Cheddar, it was superb. Great neighborhood find.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Saturday: 11am-2:30: all you can eat sushi is only $16.95

pretty darn good sushi too.  not busy, you get a seat easily.  Nice but not a scene-- which is how I like to dine on sushi.  I have had better but at this price, this is as good as it will ever get!  

I've only had sushi here, so I don't know what the other food is like, but the other tables had non-sushi meals and they looked good, big portions.

    <review:review_text>There's not much to say about the Vegas sandwich titan that is Capriotti's.  This is a solid location on the corner of Lake Mead and Boulder Highway (Albertson's shopping center), formerly occupied by Boardhouse Subs.  Since it's very close to our house, I've already been a few times since it opened.  The service was a bit slow in the beginning, but they are learning and improving very quickly.  The last time I went in you would never know that this place hasn't been open long.  There are several places to sit, it's a good sized location with plenty of parking.  Glad to have this addition to the neighborhood.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>A good broasted chicken spot was sorely needed in Las Vegas and now we have one...a great one! The chicken is made fresh- takes about 10 minutes- but well worth the wait! It has a crispy skin, hot and juicy on the inside, but not greasy at all. The crinkle cut fries as well as the sweet potato fries are the bomb! The food is awesome, the prices are very reasonable, and this is now a weekly lunch place for us! You must check this place out!!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>One liner:  If you have another option, go with that first.

We went for a Friday Night fish fry.  Service...not so good.  Food...not so good.  Best part?  Many options for the one non-fish eater in our party. 

They also had a salad bar that accompanied the fish fry.  Sad thing about that was that most of the options were empty or VERY messy.  The manager was even looking at the salad bar and did nothing to address it the entire time we were there.  Very odd.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Errrrrrrmmm....If you're open 24 hours, you should have consistent service all 24 hours, right?

I work nights and was driving through around 1am on a weeknight. It took an average amount of time, but by the time I drove the remaining 10 miles home, my food was cold. Was it because the cheese inside my cheese enchiladas wasn't even melted? Yes, yes it was. 

I'm sure I'll try again since it's 24 hours and sometimes you just gotta have Roberto's in the middle of the night, but on first experience, it wasn't so great.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The Southern Cross cafe is a contemporary eaterie where you can get everything from panini's to haggis as a main! 

I must say, my eyes almost popped out my head when I saw the price of said panini's - some of them were over a fiver! But they looked tasty, were well made and this seems to be the standard charge for any food business near the Royal Mile.

There's quite a lot of space to stretch out inside, and I like the shape of the restaurant since it's windy, abstract and off kilter. There are some intimate tables tucked away in cosy corners and enough space for a sneaky bit of people watching towards the front door.

As for the food, it ranges from Italian pasta options to Mediterranean fillings for sandwiches. As well as fulfilling your quota of carby goodness, there are also haggis options, including an appetizer pot for £3.50! This is great for the adventurous tourist or the Scottish fan of this spicy snack.

So although I almost grudged paying £2.40 for a hot chocolate, I was too swayed by the quality of this lovely little den to care about the cost.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This Carl's Jr blows, we were there for Phoenix Comicon for all 4 days.
We went to this Carl's Jr for two days because we were swamped and didn't want to waste too much time on getting full meals to go.

The workers there expect you to order the full meals so they don't have to hit multiple buttons when you just want the burger itself. The first time I ordered for me and my group of vendors, the chicken tenders came out dark brown, to the point where if you left it in the fryer any longer, they would have burned. My burgers bun came to me burnt on the inside, but everything else seemed fine, but then again I had ordered meals for the rest while I just got the burger itself.

The second day, I ordered a Western Burger without sauce (sis wanted it that way, I have no idea what she was thinking lol), it came to us without sauce but also no burger patty! They had also switched out the chicken tenders I had ordered for someone else with a regular $6 burger (I'm assuming). Luckily the vendors didn't care since they were really hungry and I didn't over-pay on anything since $6 burger is more expensive than the chicken tenders.

I honestly have no idea how they could screw up so badly on our orders two times on two different days. Both days they weren't busy, and had enough staff. The second day I think the manager was working (she was the only one wearing regular clothes, not the uniform), and they still managed to screw up our order.

So if anyone goes to this place, make sure you double check your order is right, I don't think they can handle huge orders or even the lunchtime rush correctly, and it's a huge shame because I really like Carl's Jr a lot, just not this location.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The worst Arby's I have ever eaten at. If you want a good one, visit the one on Park. 
So, here is why it is bad.
1) the portions are small on every sandwich that we ordered. Four different sandwiches. This is compared to other Arby's I've eaten at.
2) they say they don't have any monthly deals. I was told they belong to the same owner as the one on Park and they have monthly deals.
3) tried it twice and both times they messed up our order. We paid but did not get things.
4) their customer service is awful
I don't expect much in life but when I go somewhere to give them my money , I expect better than what I got here.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I think this restaurant is going to be a hit when people learn about it.  I found Boomers when I was driving around one evening.  It was closed, but I liked the the pictures of the food in the window and the cartoon dog on their logo.

I took my family there yesterday to eat for lunch.  I expected more people to be there, but it wasn't very busy.  The lady behind the counter was the daughter of the chef, so it's a family business which I like.

 My wife had the fish sliders, and my daughter and I had the cheese sliders.   We also had fries.  They have a lot of food on the menu, so next time I want to try something different.  Maybe I'll try the sandwich Mike D. had</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Like Emily, I am also a huge fan of Thistle Street. It definitely has to be one of my favourite streets in Edinburgh and I just love walking along this little cobbled street.

Thistle Street has two personalities. During the day you can stroll along and browse in all the boutiques such as Pam Jenkins and Covet exploring the gorgeous outfits, stunning designer shoes and quirky jewellery. 

By night Thistle Street almost makes you feel like you're abroad and it's only when you find yourself back on George Street that you realise you're still in Edinburgh. In the summer all the restaurant and cafes have their windows open and people can be seen sitting outside enjoying the evening air.

My favourite restaurant on Thistle Street has to be Cafe Marlayane with it's hand written menus, excellent menu and delicious desserts... it's one of my favourite restaurants ever.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I don't know if the two previous Yelpers went to the same establishment. I was excited a new restaurant was opening in the area because the current options are limited. The food was bland, portions we're light, and their "Complimentary chips" were nonexistent.I mean, isn't that the most basic thing you have at a "Mexican grill"? And to top it off their service is terrible. I left still hungry and agitated. Do yourself a favor and pass this place by, you're not missing anything.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>For some time, my idea of an absolutely perfect lunch was to go to vintage market, get a great salad, a plate of cheese and fruit and a bottle of wine.  On a great weather day, sitting outside and watching the people stroll by, there isn't much better.  Mind you, you can't do that often, but it's wonderful when you can.  It's the closest I've seen for feeling like you're sitting at a Paris market outside a busy street.  

They have great sandwiches too.  And if you aren't in the mood for my ideal lunch fantasy, they can still help you pick out a great glass of wine to go with your sandwich before you run over to see a move at Esplanade.  Or, buy a whole bottle of wine to enjoy after the movie.  I've always been given great assistance in picking out the perfect bottle.  I can almost taste it now....</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We went to the Pub for St. Patrick's day. Outstanding Corn Beef and Cabbage! Service was fast and polite. Green beer was icy cold! Place was very clean. Bar is separated from the dinning area by a glass panel. This allowed you to view the crazies in the bar but not get any of the smoke! Topped the diner off with fried Oreo's!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Gandi's is possibly my favourite Indian restaurant in Edinburgh.  It always offers delicious food in filling portions and great service to match.  As soon as we walked in the friendly waiters greeted us with a pleasant welcome, and even recognised us after having only been in once before.  The place has a really nice ambiance with all the decor making you feel right at home.
The menu has an comprehensive range of authentic Indian dishes from the classic curries to tandoori kebabs and pakoras.  I went for the lamb dansak which had tender chunks of meat in a rich sauce with lentils.  My mate went for the chicken tandoori kebabs which were seriously spicy and just about blew his head off!
All told our meals came to about £10 each and we'll hopefully be coming here again soon.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Swirls is the best yogurts place in Scottsdale arizona. Way better than Pinkberry and brogurtland . I the ice cream places in Scottsdale cannot match up to their superior ice cream and yogurt. I would recommend swirls as the best yogurt and ice cream store in Scottsdale.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Always good, friendly, and hot. My family likes this "Chinese" best in Sun Prairie. The food is even better of you eat it "in". Never full of customers (is that good?), it seems like they do a lot of take-out business. There is delivery. Not much updated decor. Good for when you want local basic Amer/Asian, same menu as all the rest. Some days it's better than others, but never bad.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place is great when you need a cup of quality Joe, but don't want to a) get out of your car, and b) go to a fast food drivethru for their horrible brew.  It is drivethru only.

The staff is always super-friendly and will come out of their little building to take your order before you get up to the window -- I'm sure this helps with people that are ordering pretentious multi-hyphenate drinks.  The coffee is good, strong and nicely priced.  They even put cool little stickers over the sipping hole in the lid so that none of the precious java spills on you.

As a disclaimer, I must mention that I am completely crushing on the gorgeous girl who waited on me today...  my cup even had a cute lip-shaped sticker on it...  was she flirting?  or was it just a random sticker?  I'll have to go back multiple times and find out.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Wow! Love this place! The sweet heat wings are my absolute favorite! While we were there they made a "test" pizza with gyro meat...that was fabulous!! They make their multiple wing sauce fresh and the ones we had were great. We had buffalo, creamy garlic Parmesan, honey BBQ &amp; sweet heat. The pizza sauce is fantastic...being from an Italian family I am very picky about my sauce and I was impressed. Will definitely be heading back there soon!!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Most frozen margarita places around the strip have the same 5 flavros with different names. Not Evening Call! This particular location has great staff! They will let you sample without pressuring you to buy. They will also make you their own special combos!

My Favs were : Sin City Cider and Jack n Cola ~ Yum!

Although a bit pricier than its neighbor the Rockin Taco, they have a ton more unique flavors.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Boulder Station (and the other Stations) got rid of Coco's and have brought back their "Grand Cafes". Look, Boulder Station is basically 5 minutes from where I live, so if I feel the need for a quick, cheap dinner on the fly - Boulder Station it is. Since BS brought back the old Grand Cafe I figured I might as well give it a go, along with my parents.

First off, the menu is basically the same old cafe menu you'll see anywhere. Breakfast (served 24-hours), main dishes, sandwiches, and desserts. Not a whole lot going on here, but hey, it's just a normal little cafe.

The service is far improved from Coco's. Whenever I went here in the past the hostess was rude, the waiters were mediocre, and you had to wave down people constantly to get refills or anything for that matter. Our waiter was a very nice guy, but he did not refill drinks and he did not come back to ask us how our meal was. He showed up at the beginning and he showed up at the end. It's just a good thing I wasn't super thirsty and only drank one glass of tea... speaking of the tea...

It was bland and it needs work. If you're going to serve tea, at least get it right. Mine and my mother's were too watery, too much ice. On to the food, my father ordered a spinach and mushroom omelet. It came out looking EXACTLY like the picture in the menu and my dad said it was really good. My mother and I ordered the $8.99 Prime Rib Special. My mom got french fries, I got mashed potatoes (mmm the gravy on the potatoes was delish!). The prime rib was cooked perfectly and it was BIIIIG. No skimping on their prime ribs here. It was served with veggies (meh) and au jus, as well as horseradish. 

So overall I'm pleased with the Grand Cafe and will return many times because it is so close, convenient, and hey, if my parents are going to pay the bill for a meal - I am down.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Lousy grocery and produce, but excellent doughnuts.

I used to live really close to this store and I always thought of it as an oversized convenience store.  It was the place we would go to when we just needed one or two things and didn't want to deal with Woodman's.  They have minimal selection and the prices are nothing to get excited about.

The doughnuts though....  YUM!  They have some of the best doughnuts in Madison.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Went here the other day for a chimi and a marg. One of my friends had recommended it as being a little better than most "border food" places.  I have to say, I was walking in expecting very little. Every bible belt fatty from the midwest was there, acting like white trash, mispronouncing every word on the menu. I'm sure you can picture the type I'm trying to describe. I made my way to the bar and watched the baseball game during lunch, even though it wasn't on when I came in. The bartender was extremely accommodating and the service was great from start to finish. I ordered the green chili chimi and it was actually much, much, better than I had expected. I actually enjoyed the dish. The margarita was weak, and wouldn't recommend that, but the food and service here are actually pretty good. Take it for what it is though, as it is still greasy, heavy, border food.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>So I am ADDICTED ..... Literally to BACHI BURGER ! 

   When Bachi HLK Finally Opened I was super thrilled. Every Saturday I usually take my daughter to Egg Works and I am so not a fan of their food but in my area there really isn't many options for early dining. 

  I went on their first day of their soft opening and the atmosphere made me feel as if I were in some rich area in France.  It was very Chic and elegant, the music was modern and played many of my Favorite songs =) I dislike dining in boring areas. The staff seemed a bit nervous but overall they were super nice, helpful and prompt with refills!  No one likes empty glasses more then I do.   My daughter had the Kids meal with Bacon, Eggs, potatoes and Fresh Fruit.  I had the Surf n Turf Eggs Benedict I totally went off my usual Carnivorous Nature which told me to get the Loco Moco with that 36 hour braised short rib... It came with a Dill Hollandaise sauce on top of a Perfectly Poached egg billowing on a mound of Smoked Turkey and Smoked Salmon.  The Sweetness of the Red Onion and the most Delicious Sweet Tomatoes I  have ever eaten cut right through the richness creating a perfect harmony of flavors in my mouth!  
   My friend got the Strawberry Banana Ricotta Pancakes, 3 huge pancakes, I had to have a taste and lets just say the next time I go in, I may have to have those as well =)  P.S.  THEY HAVE THE MOST DELICIOUS FRESHLY MADE ORANGE JUICE YOU WILL EVER TASTE!!! Trust me get it! 

I cannot wait to take more friends and show off the new breakfast/lunch eatery in my neighborhood.  If you are a fan of Bachi you won't go wrong trying this place out! Loco Moco here I Come!~</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Since I work in 3 Gateway, there's no better option for a quick pick-me-up or a mid-day meal.  I've visited the Gateway Cafe about 5 times and plan to continue trying their timely, tasty creations.

I'll start with the bad - the caesar salad isn't a great buy, considering the salad is 40% crouton and usually is composed of some less-than-fresh lettuce.  The portion is reasonable, and the price is great, but the end product is just a bit subpar.

To the good - the breakfast sandwiches are tasty!!  Real eggs, cheese, and meat, all cooked to order.  Who knew??  Not a bad price at $3 and a quarter!

Lots of drink and snack choices for those needing a caffeine surge or other boost and some of the friendliest and most gracious people around.  Give it a try!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Ok I'm probably biased because when I was little my grandparents took me here and Sam would always have candy for me and make me my own little pizza.But now that I'm older I have to say I still think his thin crust is better than any I've had in AZ. If you like spicy sausage they really pile it on with tons of cheese to keep it stuck to the crust.It's a small place but the staff is nice and they'll chat with you while you eat and offer suggestions if you are feeling adventurous.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I would Never coming back here ever!!!! Make a appointment with my regular tech. They said she is not here today but the truth is she no longer work there. The girl Jantra that did my nails did a horrible job. My nails were very ugly , crooked, and misshaped.  Come on it is a fill!!!  She told me that the owner and the employees there is treating her very poorly. I was so shocked to hear her  talked about one of her coworker (the lady that sit in the front). After that she ask for my phone number saying that she is gonna to rent a station soon and would call me to make a nail appointment with her.THIS place is very expensive and they are treated the clients very rudely. I miss all the people that work there before the new ownership.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I agree with Gavin on how grim this place appears. Like it or not, aesthetics of an establishment are important, and Aroma looks cheapened and downtrodden.

Gordon Ramsey has a steadfast rule regarding eateries. If you take pictures of your food anywhere on the menu, chances are the food isn't up to much. I would agree with him on how offputting it is, and it's one of the reasons I've passed Aroma by so long. With the poorly shot close ups of sandwiches sloppily presented, it looks like a fast food outlet in the centre of London where convenience is pitted over quality. Seeing a picture of nachos with the caption "cheese goes here" (edited in Microsoft Paint), I'm not instilled with confidence.

So after clarifying why you wouldn't want to sit in this starkly lit cafe, let's get to the food and why you would maybe want to. Saying all that, it's surprisingly not bad. It can be a bit greasy spoon at times but it hits the spot. And the prices don't hit your wallet too hard. 2 pounds for a sandwich is good whatever way you see it, and rather than thinking "you get what you pay for", you're more inclined to think "that was decent value for money".

It doesn't exhude an ambience or bowl you over with its menu, but it's convenient, the staff are efficient and for what it is, it does the job quite nicely.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Second night in Phoenix... Chinese did not go well the first night... Let's try something totally different... Was around the 16th Street / Bethany Home area... Didn't want to try Richardson's as it was so busy... Let's try the dark and secluded Mediterranean House!

Surprise! This Greek restaurant is owned by a Korean lady named Suki! What a combo! I asked her why she didn't open a Korean restaurant because you can charge up to $16 for BulGogi or Galbi. I guess she just wanted to try something different.

For starters we tried the Combination Platter which consisted of Hummus, Babaghanoush, and Falafel Balls with Pita Bread. 

I warned my friend, and any person reading this review, that Greek cooking combines herbs unlike no other country in Europe. You have to like the flavor of oregano, mint, garlic, onion, dill and bay leaves, basil, thyme, and grape leaves. Feta (Goat) Cheese is used often in their salads. And their desserts are characterized by the use of nuts and honey.

Suki could tell by my friend's facial expressions that Greek spices were not to his liking; she recommended the Cairo Special as an entree - Egyptian Chicken and Mediterranean Beef combination. The Egyptian Chicken was slightly overcooked, but had a sweet aftertaste which was interesting. The Mediterranean Beef was excellent.

I ordered the Lamb Shish Kabob - which consisted of two big skewers filled with gigantic pieces of Lamb, Onions, Green Peppers and Tomatoes! The Lamb was the tenderest I had in years - EXCELLENT! Of course, you have to like Lamb...

For dessert my friend had the Cheesecake - unfortunately store bought. I had the Baklava, which was delicate and light, with two small cups of Turkish Coffee! The coffee was not as strong as coffee I had in Europe, but is probably the best in Phoenix. (When you drink Turkish Coffee... Stir the coffee OFTEN! Grounds from the coffee will settle to the bottom if you don't... then you'll be drinking Turkish Mud! And stir in about 2-3 teaspoons of sugar, which makes it taste GOOD! I know you're going to say "that much sugar!" when you see such a small cup... trust me! When I was in Europe, my friends would often take me to breakfast establishments that would serve Turkish Coffee. (Many customers would take a couple of shots of Turkish Coffee before their workday began!).

An excellent Greek restaurant... with the proviso that one has to favor Greek spices and herbs.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I drive down Nellis quite often and for the last couple of weeks I have seen people holding signs for a new pizza place offering $5.00 take out pizza's. Today on the way home I didn't have time to fix lunch other than a sandwich so I thought I would try this place as Joey's is growing somewhat old. They only have two pizza's for $5.00 and that is the cheese or pepperoni. I opted for the sausage which still wasn't bad $7.20 out the door. 

The pizza was made in about five minutes, and was quite good for just a quick pizza, better than many around that I have had that I have paid much more for. The menu may be limited, but from the pizza I tried I will have to try more when I have the time.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>When it comes to wings I can take 'em or leave 'em. Last week a friend of mine took me here for the Wings as he hasn't shut up about the place for months. Well, the wings truly are all that and a bag of chips. I wanted to go all the way out there tonight because I was craving the wings so much. They don't mess around with the chile, lime, terriyaki, chutney Wings.This is Johnny Mac's and it's mild, medium, and hot. Not wanting to test the waters we went with the mild &amp; medium... Next time it's the hot!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The owner is super awesome and super friendly. They offer so many favors and all of them taste so good. The price you pay is outstanding because you receive so much more than what you get in other typical popcorn stores. I suggest everyone goes in and try's every flavor this wonderful store has to offer. I have been there 2 times now and we can't get enough of it and will definitely be back again!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>If you have ever watched the movie roadhouse or Coyote Ugly and thought "I have to go there!" or "That there is a drinking spot". Well, look no further then Dylan's Roadhouse (originally Dylan's Dance Hall) in Vegas. This place is not your average Vegas strip location with covers and the same fist pumping clubbers. 

This place is about 5 minutes from the strip but is diffidently worth the detour. The vibe when you first walk in is this is an "anything goes good time rock/country bar". They have a live wolf chilling at the entrance! I mean, Come On! When you walk in you are greeted to a great mixture of country and rock. 

The staff are so extremely nice and are quick to give introductions to other patrons. It truly feels like a unified party in there. Just watch how much you drink, those ladies have a heavy hand and their drinks are quite stiff. 

Beyond the bar you are also greeted to tons of TVs that play sports and old dukes of hazard videos. There is a mechanical bull, beer pong, and a huge dance floor to two step on. But out back I hear a little rumor they will show live MMA fights! Once again I give it another, Come On! How cool is that! 

This is a great place to grab a beer and enjoy some chill people who don't need bottle service to have a great time!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Came here on their 2nd soft opening day. There was a LOT of waiters/waitresses waiting at the door and greeted us the second the door opened. Two of my friend's had already arrived by the time, my friend and I had gotten there (oops i took the long way there apparently... XD or rather the slow way haha). 

First impressions - LOTS of people working. Probably to get used to the environment and process. Decor. Very simple. Red and White. First thought i had, "why does this remind me of In n Out....?" LOL anyway Design almost kept like how it was when Cafe de Japon existed. Bar area. More open now with the various table set ups. Chairs are a bit bottom heavy, so not too easy to move. 

Each person is served with a small salad bowl, even before ordering. (surprising) 

Since it is still their soft opening, they were not offering their complete menu.

Carbonara Ramen - $10.95 - "Signature ramen noodle fusion inspired by popular Italian Carbonara pasta." A soup base with the original tonkotsu pork broth and milk. Toppings included is an egg yolk , bacon, shiso, and fresh scallions. The type of noodle selected for this ramen is flat, thick noodles. 

First impression, something new to try. Their rendition of a popular italian dish, in a japanese style. Soup base, is light, due to the broth being mixed with milk (which i dont think is normal cow milk, reminds me of soy milk, maybe?). Noodles are thick, non-traditional ramen noodles, which you don't see often, but cooked to a nice al dente, which gives a nice bite ! =D The egg yolk, im pretty sure was laid in raw, and left with the broth to cook slightly? gives a nice rich flavor overall. Bacon, gives a nice flavor, esp since they had it lightly seared on a grill, but not a fan of bacon. The shiso leaf, actually look me off guard. Gives, something along the lines of maybe a basil flavor? Overall, this ramen is not bad, since its lighter than the shiroi tonkotsu ramen. Not my favorite, but i like the noodles they use. 

Shiroi Tonkotsu Ramen - $7.95 - "The best salted ramen is created with salted sauce and brown garlic oil." A soup base with the original tonkotsu pork broth with salted sauce. Toppings included is chashu pork, hard-boiled egg, fresh scallions, and kikurage. The type of noodle selected for this ramen is thin noodle. 

Thin noodles. Overcooked in my opinion. Cooked a bit too long. Lost its "bite". The soup is quite salty. Probably from the "salted sauce"... whatever that could be. Very heavy in garlic flavor, mostly from the garlic oil. It was surprising to me they did hard-boiled eggs. I'd prefer a soft-boiled egg with a runny yolk. The "kikurage" (wood-ear fungus) is quite normal to be in a japanese style ramen. The thing that was nice to me, was the chashu. In comparison to like Monta, this was not fatty at all. Majority meat, with a thin line of fat. A nice touch is they seared it on a grill. Adds a nice flavor to it. Not a bad ramen, though soup base with the salted sauce (what is this?!?) is quite salty. 

During this soft opening, they also had a few side orders available. 

Hiromaru Gyoza - $5.50 - Grilled pork dumpling

Hiromaru Buns - $6.00 - Two steamed buns filled with butabara (pork belly) and served with Hiromaru original sauce

Karaage - $5.00 - Japanese fried chicken

Pretty good ! to start off, the meat is a dark meat. On top of that, its marinated/seasoned so even the inside of the meat is flavorful. The batter used is not too thick, and is nice and crispy. Nice side to get ! 

HIromaru Japanese Curry - $8.50 - Japanese style curry rice with chashu pork

To be honest, upon bring brought out this order, first thing that came to mind, was "overpriced". At $8.50, you get about the amount of a small bowl of rice, in a pool of curry sauce, ONE slice of pork, two short spears of asparagus, and a sliver of red bell pepper. The curry sauce, .... very UNDER-whelming. Flavor wasn't there. Felt diluted. Not flavorful at all, like some curry. Some had said its like what you would get from a box of curry, at a grocery store. To me, it was not strong at all. I tasted the sauce straight up. If i had ate it with rice, id be like... uhhh wheres the curry? Aside from that, ONE slide of pork? really? wow... 

Service wise, they were very attentive. They picked up finished bowls quickly, and were quick to refill on water. Hope their attentive service will last after opening. 

On the side note, they have another room, decorated differently next door. The waitress had told us it is for dinner service for the izakaya? as well has some private VIP rooms too. The decor is complete opposite of the original side. 

Overall, not bad for a soft opening and new style. Would like to come back to try different side dishes next time (gyoza and buns) as well as the other two ramen they offer on their menu. For the price (ramen), i'd say they should include one more slide of pork though. Seemed a little "skimped out" on only have 1 slice....</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Simple menu and good noodles. The pot stickers are fresh grilled on one side. For the price especially  the food is very good.

The restaurant is hard to find right now: the temp sign is small. It is behind the chase manhattan and KFC.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Service was atrocious. We're en route from Baraboo to Chicago and had a group of 7. Though it was Memorial Day, the restaurant wasn't packed yet we waited 25 minutes for a table. Another 20 before our orders were taken and drinks brought. The restaurant itself was truly filthy - stained, disgusting carpet and very poor layout so patrons are walking through service areas. Not cool. Should have gone to Log Cabin in Baraboo.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>It's always hard to tell if I like a place because I've got a comfy seat and they're playing the music I like, or if the place is genuinely good!

A Room In The Town, however, had good service when I was in - despite the fact that I was the only person in at that time of morning.

I'd ducked in for a coffee between business meetings in the city and needed to update a report.

Sunshine streamed in through the window, the cold was a memory...it was like sitting my own loungeroom, except someone very nicely brought be a damn fine latte.

Having only gone into A Room In The Town because the service at the Standard, which used to be my regular, was so apallingly awful, it was a pleasant find.  The smells wafting out of the kitchen, the good range of menu, and the good service will make sure I head back.

That and the fact that the music playing was by an artist I love but music I had not heard before - which means I have some investigative purchasing to do!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>You would never know it from the sign out front, but this little convenience store on 56th Street and Indian School is quite a gem!  I've been in a few times over the years for a drink or a snack or what have you, but today, I decided to go pick up a sandwich, and I was super impressed!

"Proudly featuring Boar's Head," says the sticker on the saran wrap that sealed my sandwich, and it's featured on the sandwich board as well.  Boar's Head = quality, or so my husband has ingrained in my head.  He grew up on the stuff in Jersey!  

Back to my sandwich... I ordered the turkey with the works on a wheat roll.  ($5.59) It was ready in minutes and totally hit the spot.  My only complaints were that they don't offer avocado and the store has a very limited chip selection.  (note to store - please order some sun chips!)

On a positive note, they have picnic tables outside, although I took my sandwich to go.  I'll be back to this deli / market for sure - I live and work super close by!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Not sure what is up with the previous two reviews.  Bad service is one thing.  The pizza on the other hand imo is great, like someone said in a previous post, this is the site of a former metro pizza, and it seems they tried to create their own version, which  is NYC pizza, and I think they did a very god job, the pizza was better the metro's.. which is saying a bit.  I did however go there when they first opened, so things may have changed.  I will go again very soon and make an update. 4.2 stars</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This public library is a short drive from our house.  During the school year you see a lot of students here from the neighboring schools.  During the summer a lot of Moms here w/ their toddlers and young preschoolers reading.  I don't go here much although my daughter does.  They're open til 8PM four days a week which is cool for those who work later in the day.

Before we replaced our printer, I was here frequently.  Some of the librarians can be snooty but whatever.  It's a small hometown type library but has what you need to relax and read or get some work done on their computers and printers.

A good-needed staple for the area.

    <review:review_text>It's always exciting to try something new. The atmosphere is nice, the view is nice. We were quickly served our water when we were seated along with our menus. I had the spaghetti and meatballs(there's a fancy name for it on the menu) The dish was OK, but I wouldn't say amazing. My husband had the Pazanella which was simply a salad with croutons. After dinner we went to the bar for a drink and met Dustin the bartender, very nice and attentive. The chef and owner were very open to our suggestions. We would visit again and try something else on the menu. Can't beat the view!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I have eaten at Pizza Chicago a few times.  It is a nice new pizza carryout on the corner of Elliot and Rural in Tempe.  The first thing one notices when walking into the place is yellow.  It is very bright and well, yellow.  

I have eaten both the pan pizza, my favorite and the thin crust, but only to save my marriage.  

I grew up in the Chicago area and pan pizza has been my favorite for many years.  The proprietor of Pizza Chicago is from Elmwood Park Illinois, and a very friendly fellow.  He is trying real hard and it shows.  The first time I ordered there I was out running errands.  I asked them to text me when my pizza was ready.  They did and I was happy.   

The pan pizza's Pizza Chicago are delicious.  They are cooked to order so allow at least 45 minutes if you are picking it up, longer for delivery.  The timing is a problem for me.  When I order the pizza the nice order taker says the pizza will be ready in an hour, and it is.  The problem is the pizza has been sitting around for 15 minutes and is beginning to get less hot.  I like to get there when the pizza gets out of the oven, then into the box, into the car and by the time I get home it is still too hot to eat.  This requires beer to cool the pizza and the night is off to a good start.  I would appreciate a more precise pickup time.  

The crust is a little different than other pan pizza places in town.  By the way a moment of silence for Unos on Mill street.  Instead of a flaky floury crust they use a something a little grainier maybe corn meal.  Whatever it is I like it.  The sauce is thick and has a distinctive flavor,  lots of spices.  The sausage is good, mushrooms seem fresh, and the onions probably started out crispy but by the time I get them they are infused with the rest of the spices from the sauce and sausage.  Just right.  

I'm not a big thin crust pizza kind of guy.  The one we ordered was an ok example of thin crust pizza.  It came in a bag not a box, and they cut it in squares not slices.  It reminded me of all the other pizza places in Chicago, which is a fond memory. Marriage is sometimes about compromise.   I can eat the occasional thin crust pizza, and in return have a happy home.  

They have other things on the menu like Caesar, or garden salads and pasta.  My complements tot the photographer.  They look good.  

Because they are just getting started you night owls will have to order early, because Pizza Chicago closes early.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I ate lunch here today, and I actually couldn't wait to get home and review it. Whether you see that as an indication of how good this place is, or of how sad I am is up to you... but you should definitely eat there before you decide.

We went for their 2-Course lunch deal for £5.95, as we just happened to be walking past and were given a flyer. We did not regret it... although I am now extremely full!

I usually steer clear of indian restaurants as I often find the food can be very greasy and stodgy, and very often it all tastes the same. None of that is true about this place: the starter is automatically brought to you (you don't get to choose it yourself), although the waiter did ask us if we were vegetarians first. He brought us thinly sliced potatoes which had been fried in a lovely combination of spices until crispy, although I'm not going to pretend for a second that I know what they were. Alongside these we each got a huge chunk of tandoori grilled chicken and an equally massive chunk of chicken marinated in their own unique spice blend, with a side salad and home-made raita.

I'm not sure if it was the selection of mains or my boyfriend's almond and saffron lassi which was the ultimate winner, but the mains definitely played a huge part in it: there was a buffet with 4 different curry dishes - a tadka dal, a tandoori lamb curry, a veggie sweet potato &amp; spinach curry and the best one of all... chicken cooked with cashew nut paste, roast tomatoes, garlic and green chillies. Oh. Yes.

Of course, this all came with an unlimited supply of green salad, home-made mango chutney, 2 flavours of home-made poppadums and as much home-made naan bread as you can eat. As for the lassi, you need to go and try that for yourself - at £1.75 it's an absolute steal.

The best thing about all this was the bill. For two of us to eat more than, in all probability, was healthy for that time of the day, a lassi, a beer and large bottle of mineral water we paid just £17.

If you like indian food, or even think you might do but you're still not sure, I can't recommend this place highly enough.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I'm so glad this opened in our neighborhood!
It's in the Goodwill shopping center at 7th St. &amp; Union Hills.
We would have completely missed it had we not realized the new "open" neon sign.
It's very big inside..very deceiving from the outside.
Nice choices on the menu too..it's not just a pizza place..pasta, breakfast, and plenty of seating.
Nice interior with a lot of seating.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Just tried RIcky's for the first time. Staff was friendly, place was fun with club music. The food unfortunately wasn't anything to rave about. I had called ahead of time for pickup order. They had some miscommunication in kitchen. I ordered the shrimp tacos, which were bland, and the sauce they used way to much Baja sauce.

May try again if they get a new chef. For now i'll be staying with Julio Too's downt he street.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I was having a hard core burger and fry craving for a few days and decided to give in to the temptation and look up a good burger place. I am so glad I found Boomers! I decided to get a bacon cheese burger, and the hubby got a good 'ol double cheese burger. I have never had a slider but I have really been diggin onions lately, so I wanted to try one. Of course I got the combo for the fries. I had to order it to go cause the hubby wasn't feelin so well, so I got the food and got in the car and the car was instantly filled with french fry and burger goodness, I couldn't wait to the ten minute drive home, so I tried a slider. Holy Moly it was freakin amazing!!!! The fries were very good also. We got home and I dug into my huge burger and it was good, but a little over cooked for my liking. I think I will stick with the sliders and fries, but I won't hesitate to order a burger again, I will just make sure to ask them not to char so much next time. The hubby said his was awesome. 

Great burger spot for sure!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I used to work on State Street and would have loved to get a little bag of popcorn for my bus ride home, but every time I went down to Clary's it was never open - didn't matter what time of day, what day, or the weather.  Hours weren't posted, and sometimes the sign said open but there was a note saying be back in 5 minutes....I would wait, and eventually have to leave to get my bus.  When we could get in I would rave to the owner about his popcorn, and he was generally disinterested.

I finally moved my popcorn urge on down the road to Vic's, where they're not only open for business, but also give free samples.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I am not a big Smart and Final fan.

I do love two things here that I can't or have a hard time finding anywhere else. 

Sunkist Fruit Punch (for less than $3) and a big bottle of El Torito Cilantro Pepita Caesar Dressing for less than $5. This is very similar to the cilantro dressing at El Pollo Loco and is so yummy. They do have this product at Walmart but it is much smaller size for $3. 

Most of their items are over priced and/or just as much as a regular grocery store.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Had the pleasure of stopping by the other day right before their soft opening to catch the crew in the middle of training. The space looked great! I'm so happy they're doing something positive with the John E. Carson building. A little concerned with how they're able to offer fresh cold-pressed juice on the go, home made ice cream, smoothies, AND soups in such a limited space, but I have absolute faith in them. 

I got to meet Shane &amp; Nichole (owners). It's nice to be around people who are passionate about what they do on top of being absolutely knowledgeable as well. They pass that same energy down to their employees, which makes me excited and confident to be a customer there. Especially since all their ingredients are organic and mostly sourced locally.

Shane made me the Dirty Chai smoothie out of the most obscure ingredients. I was definitely unconfident of how the beverage would turn out as I watched him toss things like cabbage, ginger, pumpkin, coffee beans, and wheatgrass among a bevy of other ingredients into the VitaMix. However, all my concerns were demolished once I took my first sip. My first thoughts were, "WHAT KIND OF SORCERY IS THIS?!" Immediately followed by, "Must. Have. More." Needless to say, that smoothie was inhaled swiftly without remorse. 

My only gripe with this place is how far they are from my home, and how early they close. Being a night owl is not conducive to my need for delicious &amp; healthy items that I have to drive across town for before 3pm. BUT... That won't stop me from trying!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I love this place!  The decor is so cute, pretty, and had a clean look. We got the half Dozen which was perfect for a family of five. The employs are very nice and cater to your needs. The line was kinda long but it was not their fault more of the picky,can never make up their minds customers they had! Not a big selection of cupcakes but they just opened so I think in time it will get a bigger selection.  If you have a big party with you I would not eat there space is limited for eating but fits good for a small group around three people. This place is for sure my new cupcake place. Keep up the good work guys you have a wonderful place!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Since the BF moved to Phoenix last fall, I've been taking him on an informal tour of old school Phoenix eateries.  As part of our vintage dining tour, we finally make it to Katz Delicatessen &amp; Sandwich Shop.  It definitely has an old school feel right down to the vintage diner interior.

The food was fine.  The bagels and cream cheese were good, but not outstanding.  Our lunches were serviceable, but forgettable.  It was amusing to watch the antics of the staff that outnumbered the diners at lunch by nearly 3:1.  With so many people out front, it appeared that there was only one short order cook and our food took way too long for simple deli offerings.

The real negative for me was the restroom.  I'm not expecting a marble shrine like the men's room at the Ritz-Carlton, but I want the rest room at a place that serves food to be clean and somewhat up to date.  The men's room at Katz was on par with some gas station restrooms that I have been unfortunate enough to see.  We're talking totally gross El Bano del Diablo here.  The dining room itself also needs a thorough cleaning, but the restroom was totally off-putting for me.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This Starbucks has been remodeled and now looks like a hospital cafeteria. Gone are the plush velvety sofas and over-sized chairs which I loved to sit on while flipping through a good mag or chatting it up with a pal. No more warm and fuzzy feeling Starbucks. I hate this new look and will not be back EVER! BTW - The place was empty at 10am on a Saturday. Hmmm?</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Moist brisket is my favorite followed by ribs. Sweet corn I love. A sweet tea is always a treat. I've had everything on the menu except the prime rib and everything is always great. From Texas to Colorado, the BBQ is always great.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Friday = Great Fish Fry.  All you can eat ocean perch.  Big bowls of slaw, tartar sauce, and lemon chunks on the table.  Dignified and refined, I wouldn't eat perch anywhere else in Madison.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I was fortunate to receive an invite to BLT Steak, the newest restaurant at Bally's Las Vegas. Our table for four wasn't quite ready for us, so we grabbed a drink at the bar. Our bartender happily suggested one of their signature cocktails with basil and watermelon. It was mighty refreshing, slightly sweet and herbaceaous. I enjoyed it, but the overall crowd pleaser was their take on the Long Island Iced Tea. It was refreshing, with some bite. Just what I like in a cocktail. In addition to cocktails, they offer top shelf liquors, bottled beers and varied selection of wine. Prices range $8-$15 for most libations.

Once seated we were given an amuse bouche of pate and jelly, with toasts. It was a lovely presentation, but a bit rich. Later came the popovers that just might have made BLT famous. These monsters are light and airy, simply perfect with a pat of butter and pinch of salt. The egginess couldn't help but remind our group of Yorkshire pudding.

The menu offers seafood and poultry, but you must try the steaks ($20-$60). They are aged (mostly dry), broiled and finished with herb butter. We had the filet and bone in NY strip. Both had beautiful crust and were cooked to a perfect medium rare. More juicy and tender than you might expect. They offer sauces to accompany the steaks for a few bucks, but we agreed we liked the steaks on their own best. Though, the horseradish that came with the three mustards was the favorite. We also had the 2 pound lobster which had a lovely presentation, great flavor, it was delicate and tender; the trouble was there wasn't enough meat to it.

The sides ($10-$13) were heavy on taters, you could have them six different ways. We opted to try a variety, we shared onion rings, potato skins, hen of the woods mushroom, and caramelized brussels sprouts. We found the sides, with the exception of the brussels sprouts - now, those were delicious - to be the weakest link of the meal. We thought they were too basic, we expected a twist that would elevate your traditional onion ring or potato skin, but nope they fell flat.

Dessert ($10) was really decadent! Portions are large and good for sharing. We had the crepe souffle, warm chocolate tart, peanut butter chocolate mousse and mini doughnuts. The passion fruit sauce on the crepe would've been better served as a drizzle. It was cloying and overpowering. The tart was more of a lava cake, but the pistachio ice cream was wonderful. The PB and chocolate mousse was rich and heavenly, though, I didn't care for the banana ice cream pairing. The doughnuts were light and similar to churros and I really enjoyed the coffee ice cream.

Overall, it was a great meal. The staff, while warm and welcoming, still have kinks to work out, but in time they should be operating a well run ship. Rumor has it, the Sterling Brunch will return.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>If you are in the mood for traditional Turkish food, look no further than Nargile. Situated in Hanover Street, Nargile is in the heart of the New Town area of Edinburgh and it is just around the corner from the main shopping street, Princes Street, and so it is a convenient place to reach. 

I came here for the first time several months ago for my lunch, and I wasn't all that sure what Turkish food was when I entered the restaurant, but I had an amazing experience here, and will definitely be back. Nargile' menu offers a vast selection of choice of traditional and authentic Turkish food including kebabs, rice, fish and meat dishes. I ordered the mezze dish, which was about six or seven small portions of different dishes and they were a mixture of hot and cold meals. It was really delicious and it included kebabs and prawns marinated in a really fresh sauce that was full of flavour - really yummy! The food here is excellent value for money, with a three course meal and glasses of wine costing £20 - such a bargain for this area of Edinburgh. 

The staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming and were very patient with me in explaining what the dishes were! Nargile is a fabulous Turkish restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Quirky and comfortable, the Paisley Violin is like a non-conformist's hideaway. An unassuming building in a slightly questionable but slowly emerging art district encloses a cafe/gallery/artists-haven that serves unique sandwiches with daily specials, a full-service coffee bar, free wifi and live music. The space is quite small, especially on nights when there are musicians performing, but that just adds to the intimate and welcoming atmosphere.  The staff is extremely nice, friendly and very accommodating, and the clientele are the same.  

On my first visit there I had the olive bowl (watch out for the olive pits!), the paprika turkey sandwich and their unique daily soup special-- chipotle salmon chowder.  The turkey sandwich was delicious and the soup was a bit spicy (duh, it had chipotle in it!) but very interesting, with flavors I've never experienced.  I ended the meal with a cafe mocha, and I must say what a way to end a meal.  This was the BEST mocha I've ever had (that is why I am giving this place 5 stars!!!) Overall, a delicious meal and a wonderful time enjoying some great indie and local musicians.  I'll definitely be going back again real soon!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Okay, so I shouldn't review a bar/restaurant on opening night but I'm here now and no one else is doin' it. Glitch #1:  the LVRJ ad said: Food! Fun! Prizes for the first 100 people!"  I really didn't think we'd be in that coveted swag group even though we got there at 6:40. But seeing that Distill was re-distilling in the space occupied by the late, lamented Agave Restaurant, a cavernous place, we didn't expect to be fighting for wall space. How'd this happen?  They opened at 4:30!  What happened to truth in advertising??

They did have a buffet station set up, with pizza, round potato bites, beef strips and all the fixings for fajitas, chicken &amp; artichoke dip, bruschetta, and jumbo shrimp for shrimp cocktail. The fajitas were very good, the potato puffs were delicious, but the rest was just okay. 

Finally we snagged a booth, and except for the demo girls handing out Royal Crown &amp; Jack Daniels' Tennessee Honey samples &amp; some cute t-shirts, we couldn't snag a server even to clear the table, let alone slake our parched palates. Servers are also bussers, which didn't help speed things up. And the bar was backed up with drink orders. They definitely could benefit from a second bar. 

We did manage to fill up on the free offerings, so I'll reserve my food critique until next time. We checked out the menu, with its standard assortment of appetizers, salads, burgers, and sandwiches, and prices are pretty reasonable. But the Happy Hour (3-6 pm and 3-6 am - catering to early joggers?) menu is completely unimaginative and eminently skippable. 

I'll update my review and impressions of the food after all the excitement dies down (and hopefully the noise - this place is jet-takeoff LOUD!!!!!), but my initial impressions are just ho-hum.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Well, there are (at least) two new Waffle Trucks in town: Waffle Love AZ and Waffle Crush. Both have opened within the last month-ish and they both seem to like parking in my back yard (not complaining!) Being lovers of waffles (particularly waffles of the amazingly sweet, sugary leige-sort), we of course needed to give both a whirl.

Waffle Love AZ is an import from Utah. Their truck is brightly decorated with a mural-like painting flowing across the whole thing. Their most common East-Gilbert haunt seems to be a dirt lot at the corner of Germann and Val Vista. 

Location: Not a huge fan of the dirt-lot setup for food trucks. The actual experience of dining from food trucks is already unpleasant enough (wait in a long line outdoors, wait for your food, no place to sit, no easy way to eat your knife/fork food, etc) but then add to that the dusty dirtiness of a dirt lot, the haphazard parking and dealing with the drivers trying to find parking, and the fact that because the lot is not an actual place, it means that there isn't a convenient place to turn through traffic to get in, this was just not my favorite. They also had incredibly bright floodlights set up on the ground shining towards the truck. This was fine until you turned from the truck to head toward your car and were completely blinded just prior to heading into a dense crowd of people across uneven rocky, rutted ground.

Process: The line was long and did not move very quickly. The girl who was advancing along the line wasn't taking orders, per se... she was just jotting down your name and order onto the cardboard tray that would later hold your waffle. I didn't like that she came up to us when we were so far back in the line that we could literally not yet clearly see the menu, yet alone determine what we'd like to order, so we were put on the spot a bit. When we got to the front, a friendly Chef took our trays, rang us up, and had us use an iPad to run our credit card. There was an option for tip (15%, 20%, 25%, custom) We then waited another 15+ minutes for the order to be ready - it was a little difficult to hear them calling names and there were so many people that it was tough to get close enough to be sure you'd hear it.

The Menu: There's just one type of actual waffle - Belgian Leige waffles. From there, you can determine your toppings at an additional cost. Toppings include Nutella (classic), Biscoff (an amazingly delicious cookie spread that is the perfect graham cracker/cookie element to any s'more waffle dream you might have), Cream (but not the cheap whipped cream out of a can - thick, almost icecreamy cream) and strawberries, raspberries, bananas.... One thing that did disappoint me about the menu is that there wasn't really a simple, non-knife and fork option for the waffles outside of just getting a completely plain waffle. An option with cinnamon and sugar, or perhaps peanut butter (?) or something else that is more basic would be awesome for littles who may not appreciate the more advance offerings. There are also a small variety of drinks offered - hot apple cider, hot chocolate, milk, water.

The Goods: the waffles are delicious Liege waffles that use special waffle irons that caramelize the sugar on the waffles providing a crispier, sweet exterior that contrasts the soft and fluffy interior perfectly. The toppings are high quality and proportioned well so that you can create a perfect bite each time with a little bit of each element. I got what I think they called "The Classic" - Waffle, Biscoff, Strawberries, and Whipped Creme and it was certainly tasty. 

Service: Everyone seemed nice, just a little rushed and there wasn't a whole lot of interaction, all of which is, I'm sure, because they were so very busy. 

Overall - I did not like the location or setup a whole lot, the menu was just a little more limited than I'd have liked, but I think their waffle recipe is superior to other liege waffles I've tried elsewhere. The pricing is a little less than the other truck. They do offer a punch card, so if you plan to make visiting a regular occurrence then that can be a good perk! They did not (that I saw) offer "to go" containers as an option, but I may have missed it.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I was just  visiting Phoenix over the weekend for the Rock N Roll Marathon on  Jan. 14th. We were staying at the Hyatt Regency on 2nd Street &amp; Monroe, walking distance from the Arizona Center that is blessed with Sam's Cafe! 
I can be a demanding customer due to my dietary needs. I am always in need of altering my menu selection and substituting items. Sam's wait staff &amp; chef were extremely accommodating to me. I had the Fish Tacos on Saturday night with a full serving of steamed vegetables instead of the rice &amp; beans it usually comes with. They also gave me the Chipotle sauce on the side and plenty of salsa... (GOOD salsa)!
We were so pleased with our meal &amp; service that on our last night in town we opted to return to Sam's Cafe knowing we would be satisfied with our meals and the menu has alot of goodies to choose from. I had the Salmon this time on a bed of veggies instead of sweet potatoes. I did let myself indulge in some of their tasty and chips with the chunky &amp; tasteful salsa, (I just ran a marathon)! The chips themselves are very unique mixture of blue corn tortilla, sweet potato chips, and some other varieties...GOOD! 
I will return on any visit to Phoenix!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I love small, friendly dive bars. They always have the best mix of people in there. And most are normally regulars so they know everyone and are always friendly to the new faces at the bar. Kat's is no different.

Cheap drinks, friendly bartenders, good people, jukebox, pool tables, video arcades, and a toy crane that can win you some porn. That's what I call a great bar.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place is all hype and nothing memorable. Burgers and hot dogs were not A or even B quality. I had to try it since it was late and pretty few restaurants were open at this hour. If you come here just for the tater tots, then maybe I can understand. Wait, NOPE. Go to In n Out before coming here or even Whattaburger which is right across the street. Still better than Sonic. 

Hot dogs = terrible. I'd rather have Nathan's or Weinerschnitzel. Too thin and no flavor. 

Now I can say I've tried it and I'll never be coming back here. I think the only thing they have going for them is the ability to customize your drink flavors if you get a slushie. I can see college students packing this place but why when you can find other fast-food joints at the same price.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>It's really nice here - comfortable booths and seats, and lots of space. It feels kind of diner-ish, but with a hint of cocktail bar vibe too. Their gin and tonic menu is wonderful - following our tutorial at One Square I now know how important the right tonic is and they explain on the blackboard which tonic will be served with which gin (including the Caorunn and Fentiman's pairing offered at One Square). Much better than just dumping a Schweppes into everything!

I had the haddock and chips, which was really quite delicious. Sure, I said in my last fish supper review that I was ruined for fish'n'chips forever, but I think the indoor dining experience is somewhat different, and these weren't chippy chips; rather, they were skin-on wedges. It wasn't as plentiful as I might have hoped, though, given the price of £11 (when is haddock and chips ever the second priciest thing on the menu?) - there were probably about twelve wedgey-chips although there were two strips of haddock fillet, which were tender and falling apart beautifully, and the batter was wonderful. The buttered peas, oddly, were the highlight - very sweet and flavoury (I told you, it's totally a word).

Our waitress seemed a little brusque in her manner, but was very efficient and helpful nonetheless, and I really appreciated that the music wasn't banging at a massive volume. What I did hear was a good playlist too - Joni Mitchell, Paul Simon, Radiohead - applause for that.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>It's hard to make bad pizza, but Papa Sams makes bad pizza. You take a bite and the cheese slides off in a sheet of cheese. It almost like the cheese isn't even baked on there but microwaved? I tried it twice to see if maybe I got a bad pie, but they were both terrible. Chicago style? I think not.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>A good one-stop shop if you're ravenously hungry during lunchtime and sick of five-dollar footlongs...

- falafel pita sandwich is worth noting...not bad, not bad at all! Comes loaded with three fresh/crispy falafels, hummus, and a side of tahini complimented with lettuce and tomatoes
- I've seen the classic gyros sandwich, it's as big as my body, chocked full of meat, enough to last you a whole week...or a couple of hours depending on your appetite..
- your eyes will be happy, lots of pictures of menu items for you to choose from

Hungry beware....
- order your food and take a nap because it takes LONG to come out
- don't come here with 20 of your friends because you won't find a place to sit...it's a teenie weenie (hence one-stop shop) joint and the tables are tiny hidden in the back, you're better off getting it to-go
- standard prices apply, but it's not bad for really fresh food</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>First time eating here &amp; it was great! Friendly staff &amp; good customer service! I had the gyro chicken with fries &amp; a drink for only $8.99! Definitely a bang for a few bucks! Would definitely recommend my friends and family about this place for first timers or lovers of middle eastern food! Need it come back soon again!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We went here for a dinner celebrating our Twin girls birthday.  It was a very nice space, setup similar to a Noodles and Company.  The specialty is mac n' cheese and they have many variations.  

The food was delicious, without a doubt.

The windows were really bright though and we found ourselves sweating from the setting sun pouring into the west facing windows.  The manager told us shades were on the way.

Highly Recommended and we will visit again.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The place is alright, and the overall atmosphere is great. The service level is top notch and our waiter n waitress were polite. One gripe is the menu is very limited compare with some of the good Korean BBQs I've been to in the past as I went on a Sunday evening. Another gripe is the pricing is relatively high as compared to dollar per menu item. The all you can eat does help but you quickly get tired eating the same thing round after round after round. I would go again, only occasionally.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Been here 3 times and all 3 times the store was not fully stocked. Not organized nor clean. The pictures they posted are deceiving...shelves were empty.  Not a huge choices of masalas compared to other Indian stores. I was not greeted by the staff... They were very cold. Smile goes a long way.
Unfortunately this was the closet store to me but I will have to drive further out to another one.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I have been to this restaurant twice in the past month. The first visit, was a Thursday night when I had just picked my tired husband up at the airport. Fresh off the plane, arriving from my home state of Rhode Island, he wanted to speak of nothing but steak.

He had chatted with a local about a good steakhouse downtown; I think he had the wrong name, we got stuck Chase field traffic, but I digress.

After doing a quick Garmin search in our rental (a whole separate review) I saw Omaha Steak House. Would have never usually gone with this choice, but its the only name we knew I had to get this man a meal immediately.

Pleasant surprise. So, let me break it down:

First visit, Thursday evening around 9 pm

Empty

Great decor- This restaurant is in the middle of a hotel, so I am comparing to other hotel restaurants.

Service- The waiter happened to be from our home state. Great conversation, great service, excellent all around.

Food- We started with the fried calamari- excellent choice. So good that we ended up getting a second order (give us a break- we were famished). I have high standards for any seafood- even if we are just talking about fried fish. This calamari was fresh and on par with good calamari back in RI.

Husband had steak- he was very happy. He does med-rare- it was cooked perfectly. I trust his steak critique more than my own- he is much more involved in seeking out great steaks &amp; better butchers.

I had stuffed shrimp- It was great. 

Sides- asparagus &amp; Yukon gold mashed. Again, both were great.

Second visit- My parents are in town this week from RI.

We went last night and I would say our experience matched the one above. We arrived around 9:30 and it was already quiet again. 
The parents like good food &amp; service minus anything overly trendy. This place did the trick. They left with smiles.

Summary
I have this restaurant on file as reliable, consistent, and basic. A place you go when you seek out good hearty food, reasonable prices, quiet atmosphere, and are all about a good quality meal. Also, for me its a place I can go when I am not up for "going out" but am up for getting a good meal minus the cooking &amp; cleaning. Not that I was in sweats, but I was comfortable and passed on getting dressed up for a night out.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I have been at this butcher a couple of times and have never had a bad experience. 

George Bower has the most fantastic selection of game and poultry.  e.g. if you want pheasant or venison, go and get it from here! 
I have bought pork fillet and a BBQ selection pack of chicken. 

They also sell all the other traditional products like sausages, meats, steak pies. 

The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The shop itself has a lovely sort of old fashioned feel to it with the decoration.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I have to agree with both Pierre and Donald. However there are 2 menu items worth ordering. I get them togo all the time for lunch. The lettuce wedge and the willy burger. The steaks are awful! They put some crap they describe a seasoning that is so overpowering you can't eat it. Also someone needs to teach the cook the difference between Med rare and Well. I know I know that is a big difference but when I ordered the rib-eye med rare I got a hockey puck! Sidebar the bread is really good when you get it hot. 

The wrap up burgers are good and the lettuce wedge rocks, skip the steaks!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This location is BRAND new...when you walk in the decor is awesome all set up like a true firehouse. It was our first time trying this chain and I admit it was overwhelming at first. We were greeted right away but when advising it was our first time here nobody made a huge effort to assist in our choices. We were helped by someone named Aubrey who was very SWEET and HELPFUL. Problem is she definitely didn't seem to know what  they did or didn't have in stock. We ordered two kids meals and two adult choices. My Mom got a Italian I believe and I got the Chicken Salad - Chopped Salad. Which threw Aubrey off at first as well but I am trying to stay away from bread. Anyhow long story short they were out of Meatballs for the sub I got my son. Now I realize they are new but I just don't see how they weren't more prepared? The manager was nice enough to offer a refund but i just opted for a ham sub for him. He liked it fine but I can't give this place four of five stars when they ran out of chili and Meatballs. It seems like they weren't prepared for the business and if I was advised BEFORE I paid I would of possibly bumped this up to four stars but over all I wasn't WOWED it just literally was OK. The service was really friendly though and the location nice and clean.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place, located at the corner of 6th Street and Ogden, is an excellent addition and alternative to the DTLV/East Fremont Street District bar scene. The space is light and airy up front with high ceilings. Toward the back there are darker, more intimate booths. If you continue toward the back and around the corner, it opens up into a large room with a sizable movie screen and an upstairs area that's available for private events. 

This spot is a great place to come if you want a good selection of wine and craft cocktails with attentive but unintrusive service and want to avoid the chaos of East Fremont. Excellent for a date or catching up with a friend.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Monty's is a Madison favorite.  Breakfast all day.  Fantastic comfort food.  Friendly service.  Veggie options.  While nothing spectacular, it's consistently pretty damn tasty.  Of note: popular breakfast (expect to wait) and the Meatloaf of the Gods.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I quite enjoy a bit of the Royal Family and their history. I think it's because I would like to live in a castle or palace. Actually I think Holyrood House would be perfect for me, Queenie has her big house in London and her estate in Balmoral so maybe it's time she let it out to someone like me?

It is rather expensive for a trip round Holyrood House (13 pound for a student... eeeek) so it isn't the top of my list of places to go in Edinburgh. But the Royal Apartments are very beautiful and full of wonderful decor and paintings. In the summer the gardens are open so after viewing the house you can go for a wander around the gardens which are perfectly nice gardens. 

If you have an interest in the Royal Family then this is a must do.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>A neighborhood, hand-crafted, independent cafe. High quality, healthy menu. Fiercely motivated and fiercely motivational! Moderate price.

This is a great place for breakfast or lunch or late night (advertising 6am-midnight hours). Great for kids, with a ton of healthy, kid-friendly selections like fresh squeezed Orange Juice. Tip; you can watch them squeeze the juice right in front of you if you sit at the bar.  Outdoor seating means dog-friendly.

A wide selection of lunch-y, snack-y stuff like soup and sandwich/soup and salad combos make this a great place to meet and greet. Situated on the border of Spring Valley neighborhood and Westside neighborhood at the corner of Desert Inn and Rainbow on the NORTHWEST side of the intersection, this venue is minutes from the strip. Driving from Las Vegas Boulevard, take Sahara west (up) to Rainbow,  turn left (south) on Rainbow. The cafe is on your right with private, off-street parking.

The coffee drinks are just too numerous to describe in one review, but everything you can imagine is on the menu.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>So, to remove any confusion.  This is NOT a part of the El Torito chain of Mexican restaurants found in most of Southern California.

This El Torito is a family creation that still sits on Boulder Hwy in Henderson on the way to Boulder City.  The area that it lives in used to be surrounded by unique businesses.  Such as Old Vegas, which was for the most part a Western Theme Park, the Nevada History Museum, and a Motel...I can't remember it's name but is resembled the Bate's Motel from Psycho.  

Now most of those places are gone but El Torito still stands and is still family owned and operated.  Some of the menu has changed and they've added some American fare, but the old recipes still exist and are worth a try.  My favorite is still their Albondigas soup....which is a meatball soup with onions and other such vegetables in the broth, yum.

If you're passin' through Hendertucky on the way to Lake Mead, make sure you stop by and get a plate Taco's....it'll make your tummy smile.</review:review_text>

The service and the food is Amazing. The Texas Rose is super yummy! The Ribeye was cooked to perfection.

I wish there was a Lone Star in the California Bay Area!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We've been going here for 20 years and love the place. The machaca is great, the whole bean burritos are good, as are the potato and bean burros. The chili rellanos are good. The salads are only OK.  All salsas and sauces are made that day and are fresh. Beans aren't cooked with lard, but are cooked with vegetable oil. Portions are small, taste is flavorful. Rosa the server/owner is friendly  and Maria her mother is the cook.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place is really good. They use premium Blue Bell Ice Cream and their ice is like eating a cloud. They serve ice cream. Hawaiian style snow cones.  Ton of different flavors to choose from. They had my favorite, Tigers Blood. You can add sweet cream to the top. Very inexpensive. My family of 4 all got treats and the total was under $10.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I'm not the biggest fan of coffee shops, I guess the fact that I don't like coffee doesn't really help matters. I do, however, quite like this branch of Starbucks on Nicolson Street. It isn't as big as other Starbuck chains which makes it feel a lot more cosy and friendly which many huge branches lack as they feel so impersonal. 

As Gavin said, Nicolson Street is also a great location and as I tend to find myself on this street rather a lot, it's the perfect pit stop for me. 

Usually my order is a Tazo Chai Tea (with extra cinnamon sprinkles) and a lemon and poppy seed muffin. Delish!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>From the moment I walked through the entrance, I was... Entranced. Punny but true. Larger than I expected, and darker, more romantic, was this beehive around which there had been such buzz. There was beautiful, unusual art on the far wall, and fairy lights twisted around the mantel above the warm electric fire. Behind me, a vast blackboard proclaimed the day's specials in proud lettering, and the staff bid me a friendly hello as I pranced past, a spring already in my step.

So the setting was a joy. The company, as with all Yelpy get togethers, equally so. All that remained was to sample the food.

Well, you can see from the rating just how that turned out. For a starter I tried the day's vegetarian special, the roasted mushrooms with garlic and melted taleggio. I tell you, I would happily come back for that dish alone, but the free range chicken supreme with cream cheese, ham hock, bacon, and mustard and veal jus on smoky potatoes maintained the flavour explosion. The final master stroke - a clementine and butterscotch mess presented like a knickerbocker glory topped with a glacé cherry - was fiendishly good.

When you add to all of this how close it is to the Queen's Hall, my favourite venue in Edinburgh, and the fact that they have a two-course deal if you're early enough to vacate by seven, and you have one place I am very, very likely to return to many times...</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Considering it's not much more than a lunch room for the surrounding offices, it's really not bad. Most of the sandwiches I've had there have been ok experiences. The service is quick.  

I've noticed that they sometimes will spoil an otherwise really good dining experience by doing something like leaving pits in certain olives that appeared to be without pits. Or some of the cole slaw will be wilted. Or the shell in the clam chowder mentioned earlier. I don't consider these events fatal flaws, but y'know . . . come on. . . . a little more effort.

I don't like how the line is laid-out. The path from ordering and paying to picking up your food and drink is convoluted and annoying. They could improve their flow and ergonomics and make take away some of the anxiety I feel before going there--and thus I might go there more frequently.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>What I like about the downstairs bar is that you get very limited cell phone service. So if you're with someone who happens to be additcted to their crackberry- then this is your place.
The food is rich and awesome- I especially like their seafood selections.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Bomb ass lemon danish. What makes something so ordinary sounding SOOO good you ask?? The strong flavor of lemon, the fresh bursting blueberries, the flaketastic crispy buttery danish pastry. 

Having made puff pastry croissants a week ago, I know how hard it is to get just the right consistency on your pastry. I took one bite of this thing on a hot afternoon, intending to split it with my better half. NO SUCH LUCK for him. It was gone in 60 seconds, down the hatch...as I wore a finger lickin' good smile.

My mission is now clear. Perfect that puff pastry dough and make a little army of these fruity lovelies to pepper all over my belly and thighs. Heaven.

Oh yeah, they serve breakfast here too, as in egg and cheese croissants, and you can charge it to your room since the hotel owns this cute little shop. Bonus.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I came through this dive while pub-crawling amongst friends. As we lined up at the bar to order beers and grub -- the bartender's muttering under her breath "oh shit." should have tipped us off to the piss poor service that awaited us. Apparently they're not accustomed to seeing a group of ~12 people waltz in this dump. Go fig'. Mind you, we were very accommodating, and considerate of the surprise rush we created. However, when they served our table separately and completely forgot my food, I was forced to demand a refund. They're lucky I wasn't a complete a**hole and demanded the portion of the tip that I already paid toward my food order.

Sure, if you're looking for a very lonely dive all to yourself and a /few/ friends, this might be your place. But for us, it was a complete and utter disaster.

Oh, did I mention the incessant flies throughout the establishment? Yeah, not cool.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We were thrilled that a new location was opening as we had stopped going to the Miller's in Town Square because it was continually over-crowded during the UFC Fights and people were just rude making it impossible to enjoy the fights. It's pretty much the same set-up as the other location but service was spot-on! Our server was very mindful of stopping by, refilling our drinks and making sure we were happy with our food. Tables were spaced out and we didn't feel like sardines during the UFC Fight. We did determine that, as non smokers, it's not a good idea to sit by the windows overlooking the patio area as the smokers seem to mingle right by the window even though the outside seating area is further away. 

My only complaint is that they have done away with the raw bar which, besides the UFC Fight, was the only  reason for visiting. I loved their raw oysters as they always tasted fresh--better than some of the high end restaurants we've visited. Please bring the raw bar back!!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I was in town for business and got back to my hotel around 7PM (dinner time). Having work to do for my client, I decided that I would order food to be delivered to my room and chinese food sounded great! 

I ordered General Tso's Chicken, a small Pork Lo Mein, and the fried dumplings. I thought I was in for a treat as I don't often get the chance to have chinese food. Little did I know, that the food about to be delivered from Taste of China @ 5415B Monona Dr, Monona, WI was horrible.

The chicken smelled a little different, but when i tasted it I could tell that it had been left out on the counter for hours instead of being in a cooler prior to preparation. The pork lo mein was OK, so I ate some of it and the dumplings were edible.

The next day, I was sick all day. I called the resteraunt and complained when I got back to the hotel and they offered to replace my order. No way was I going to go for round two of the food poisoning game. Instead I told them that I would be posting this review and reporting them to the health department. DO NOT EAT THERE!! YOU WILL BE VERY SORRY THAT YOU DID!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Love it already!  Had to go on the grand opening as we'd been anxious for this BW's to open since we first saw the sign that it was coming!  They were BUSY at 11AM and they didn't miss a single beat!  Servers were friendly, smiling, attentive, and seemed genuinely excited to be there! The vibe is awesome there, the layout with the TV's and decorations were excellent. Every other restaurant in this building has closed within the first couple of years, however I'm betting with this Buffalo being here, they're in for the long haul! Keep up the excellent work, we look forward to coming back! :)</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The only reason I knew about this place was a hand lettered sign stuck into the ground outside the Viet Hoa grocery. 

Some authentic items here, including congee. We had the General's Chicken, Mao Po Tofu and Curry Chicken. The food arrived very quickly to our table, and it was good. The General's Chicken was spicy but complex. The Mao Po Tofu was generous. The Curry Chicken was mild. 

This is a small rectangle of space within Viet Hoa devoted to a tiny restaurant. But it felt for a moment like we were back in a corner of San Francisco's Chinatown. For that alone and the attentive staff we will go back and try some of the more adventurous dishes.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Hmmm...After going along to BMB on its opening day on the 4th July, I've been humming and hawing as to what to write. I so very much wanted to enjoy this place. It's always an amazing day when you find that a fairly pretentious coffee house is being replaced with something a lot less so! The restaurant is literally across the road from my work and would be an excellent Friday treat for myself and the rest of the office.

The decor is typical of a lot of places these days - exposed brickwork, unpainted woodwork, hodge-podge furniture etc. And the staff were very accommodating and friendly. All very much a positive, imo.

There were 4 of us in our party and the 3 guys all opted for the cheese burger, and 2 of them had fries on the side, and I being veggie, had the 1 option on the menu - the Magic Mushroom Burger. All burgers cost the same amount: £7.50 and this is where things get a bit....erm...meh....

The food arrived around 30 minutes after we sat down. We were all presented with greaseproof paper mats, on top of which came our paper-wrapped burgers. Call me old fashioned, but I like plates or boards to eat off of! This is essentially fast food at gourmet prices. My £7.50 got me a brioche bun with a mildly spicy bean patty, a mushroom, a dollop of crème fraîche, a bit of salad and a mildly spicy salsa. It's important to note that all sides are separate. I remember looking enviously at the gherkins which the guys seemed to have and thinking that just a bit of 'pep' might have changed my entire experience. There's a common misconception that veggie sometimes means bland. Maybe the introduction of some spicy condiments might help out here. I felt a little short-changed, if I'm honest. The Southern, for example, offers a multiple choice of veggie options and comes with a side of fries and a side of slaw for around 50p more. 

I really don't want this to be a damning review, after all the 3 guys who I was with absolutely loved their meals, but I just came away feeling that the vegetarian option was simply tacked on to appease folk like me. I will go back as my better half wants to check it out, but I think the next time I really want a burger, I will go to the Southern or Wanaburger and get a hell of a lot more bang for my buck, both in terms of value and actual sustenance.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Made in France is far more than your average deli. The owners have sourced everything in the shop themselves from independent French suppliers to give the customers a far more authentic French experience. Real Toulouse sausages and Raclette cheese hang from the shelves between bottles of wine and vinegar. For me though one of the nicest things I discovered were the tiny pots of apple puree that you get in every French supermarket but are impossible to find over here. Basically it's baby food, mushed up apples in a squeezy pot, but wow it just tastes so good! 

It was only on my second or third visit here that I also discovered that Made in France hire out Fondue and Raclette sets too. Having never had the urge to hold a fondue party (I lie, I always have the urge but I fear it would be a habit I couldn't quit) I'm yet to try one of these sets out myself but I bet it would be a lot of fun. The shop prepares the cheese for you so all you have to do is melt it and dip stuff in. Cheesy deliciousness!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This was always our after the bar, the movie or something that lets out after 9pm kind of spot when we wanted something a bit "classier" than Denny's.  Growing up in N. Phoenix, getting here was enough of a drive that it became it's own adventure.  

I'm totally down w/ their shakes.  I love the Diner feel.  I love that you can sit outside on a good night.  Heck, I love the tiny booths with the jukebox - even though everyone knows there are SO many requests ahead of you, you won't get to hear your song you have to put in a quarter and do it anyway.  

But I just got through going by there at about 7pm on a THURSDAY and the parking lot was packed!  PACKED!  I don't get it.  It's good.  I will never take anything away from that - but packed at 7 on a Thursday?  Wow.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Over priced and everything costs extra. I ordered 2 enchiladas for $10 plus $1 for sour cream and I decided I couldn't afford the guacamole.  I asked for a side of chips - $5?! No thanks. The manager (older Hispanic man) was aware of my request for a small side of chips and pretended not to see or hear me.

For a food court, not a good deal. On a more positive note, the food tastes good.
Older Caucasian woman was the only nice server.  Ugh!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I met a group of "Spa Girlfriends" here for dinner before we had a big meeting at the Doubletree. We needed something fast, yummy and close to 44th and Van Buren.

Bingo!

I preface this review by stating that since i was in a group of 7, I didn't necessarily order the items that I would order (does that make sense?).

We had one great specialty dish (had the word Phoenix in it) with chicken and large shrimp and veggies in a spicy brown sauce - delicious! Other entrees included house special chow mein, beef &amp; broccoli and sweet &amp; sour pork. Again, not items that I would have picked, but for the group, it worked.

The main reason I give Lao Ching Hing 4 stars is it totally passed my "sauce test." I am big on sauces. Specifically, the consistency of the sauce (and, of course, taste). I hate runny sauces ... I hate when there is not enough sauce .... And it's harder than you might imagine to get it right. 

All of the sauces were great. Perfect consistency and very flavorful. I'm not a huge fan of sweet &amp; sour anything, mostly because I survived college working at a fabulous restaurant in Tucson called The Mandarin Grill and quickly learned the difference between real Chinese cuisine and Americanized Chinese cuisine. Sweet &amp; Sour is the quintessential Americanized Chinese dish. 

The chow mein was fair - not spectacular, but not greasy (the way it often is at restaurants).

The service was great. I never got close to emptying my water glass, and our group had a nice big table in the back where we could be as chatty and spunky as we wanted. The food arrived quickly, and everyone managed to clean her plates. 

I will return!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Hello Brass Tap!! This place just opened in the Mesa Riverview plaza, over by Toby Keith's. If you are a beer person, here is a new place to visit! Over 300 different beers to choose from! Did I just say 300!!! Yes!!! That many!!

I personally cant drink beer, but all my friends love it, so we ended up meeting here for my friends bday! Each of them enjoyed the large selection and were able to try a lot of beers they have never had before. While they were busy getting their drink on, I of course had to try the food! Their food menu is a little small (compared to having a choice of 300 different beers to drink, but hey its a beer bar) I went ahead and ordered the Pepperoni Peppadew Pretzel Pizza! Goodness gracious this pizza was delicious! The pretzel dough bread wasn't too thick to where your pizza was all bread and it had a great buttery/seasoned taste to it. The tomato sauce had a nice spice and the sweet peppers on top of the pizza along with the pepperoni, brought out a taste I have never had on a pizza before! It was delicious! These ingredients altogether made a really great pizza. The 7 1/2" pizza was in my belly in about 2 minutes!

We came here on opening night, so the service wasn't fantastic, but it wasn't terrible. Opening night is always going to be a little hectic and stressful! I think the staff did a decent job though. Our waitress said they didn't have the flights for the beer taste testers yet, so she had to bring them by hand and it seemed like each time she mixed up the samples, so we didn't know which beer was which. So once they get those in, im sure that will get better. You are a beer bar though, you should have had those ready!! The service was also a little slow, but the bar was packed so you cant get too upset. The girls were running around trying to take care of everyone as best as they could.

This place is very relaxed, chill and on the small side. If you are looking to just enjoy an evening of beers, good friends and conversation, this is the place! No loud music, dancing or craziness. Over-all 3 stars for this new place as an A-OK! Gotta work out some of the little kinks and things will be better! Keep it up! Im sure I will be back!

*My friends votes are in and they say to try the Historic Deer Lord and the Petrus Aged Red beers! Cheers everyone!!*</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I hardly noticed this pub until I was in a pub crawl in my second year in Edinburgh. We apparently  had stumbled into a pub quiz and much to other clients horror, decided to partake in. Its exterior hides a rather reasonable size interior- by no means as big as its dominant neighbour the Pear Tree. One sort of forgets about the outside world (and weather) in this cosy pub too so very good for a cold winter night. Other than this factor, it didn't really draw me in any way or really stick out from other pubs of the area.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Really great flavored oils and vinegars, along with a thoughtful selection of complimentary foods and wine.  The store is set up for customers to taste the oils and vinegars and some of the spice rubs, sea salts, tapenades, chocolates, etc.  Great pastas including traditional, gluten-free and low carb.  They produce some great gift baskets and will do custom baskets as well.  Located in the District at Green Valley Ranch.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Excellent donut shop in town square located by Aveda and Mac store. It is not easy to find if you aren't looking. Space is very small. They serve some creative donuts, like fruit loops sprinkled donut. I opted for the strawberry shortcake donut ($1.75) which was very good. Will definitely come here again. Apparently there are four locations in the valley.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Been here a few times, but most recently the other day.  Taking Mona's suggestion - I had the andouille sausage linguine and it was decent.  My friend had the flank steak that I wish I had ordered.  It was cooked to perfection and rested in a blackberry mole reduction.  On previous visits, I've had the atlantic salmon and vegetable lasagna - both great choices.  The service is usually good, except this time I felt the server was either overly attentive - borderline rushing us....but it wasn't a big deal.  The environs are terrific - white tablecloths with kitschy cute 1940s classroom chairs.  Weird touch, but retro cool.  A recommended central Phoenix favorite.

UPDATE - 1/25/07
The hostess was very gracious and accommodating checking on us every so often as we had drinks and waited for our table.  The owner came out and chatted with us after the meal to make sure everything we great, and even went back to the chef to clarify ingredients for me, plus added a little back story on the halibut sandwich w / german potato salad.  Definitely a friendly, homey atmosphere.  Loved it.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place just reopened a few months ago following a long-overdue remodel. It's a good place, no questions asked. Not the best Chinese restaurant I have ever eaten in, but a worthy one nonetheless.

As far as atmosphere goes, the interior here is a bit more "casual" than most Chinese restaurants. Most of this interior decor feels more like something that belongs at Denny's or IHOP. Fortunately, there isn't a whole lot of excess noise either. During my last visit, a TV behind the counter was showing Seinfeld - not complaining or anything, but if you want an authentic Chinese experience, atmosphere and all, this isn't the place for you.

But the food is what counts, and each time I have been here, I have had no complaints with it. They have a large, diverse menu - quite possibly one of the largest of its kind. Regardless of your tastes in Chinese food, I'm sure you'll find something you like here. 

China Inn doesn't really do anything to stand out amongst the other Chinese restaurants in town, but with food items this solid I could care less. Definitely worth stopping by if you're a fan of Chinese food and are in the "Old Henderson" area.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Waited for this restaurant to open. I was hoping it was not going to be another all you can eat sushi places. BINGO!! The furthest thing from it. The food was ultra delicate with each dish having its own flavor. The chef/ owner makes his own tofu. We ordered the tofu sashimi. Never had it before and I thought it was very nice and light. The jalapeño yellowtail ... Very good great presentation. Foiled steamed halibut was also a winner. The chick karaage another good presentation, crispy and very juicy. Price was pretty average for this style of Japanese. Service was good. Would come here again.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Underwhelming at best.  I'm really trying to give Fox Restaurants an honest shot, because I really do want a local business to succeed. But sadly there really is just nothing extraordinary about the burgers here.  I wish I would've blown the calories on a double double from In-N-Out.  And you certainly shouldn't come here for the drinks.  Bartenders seem blindsided by pouring beer and wine, and the cocktail list is vodka-fantastic...par for the course in north Scottsdale.

I would suggest driving the extra 20 minutes to Delux.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Every time I come here I can always rely on great customer service and cookies that my little chihuahua LOVES. I think its great there is a place like this that exists. They have a dog happy hour that I have never been to nor taken my dog but I have heard nothing but great things about it. They pet clothes are kind of tacky sometimes but for the most part the toys and treats are what made this place the best.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I used to like their food
Honestly.

It was my one year anniversary.
Me and me man went here to celebrate

I had a lobster tail
And a filet

On the way home, I got violently ill
Like, within ten minutes of leaving this place.
And no, I only had a few glasses of champagne :)

I ended up going home, and laying on the floor for awhile crying, moaning, vomiting, etc

After about an hour, I couldn't take it anymore
I called 911

The paramedics showed up, I was naked and crying on the floor.

It was a VERY romantic anniversary, let me tell you.

After a long night at Scottsdale Osborn hospital, it was determined that the lobster tail was undercooked/tainted and made me severly ill.

I'll never eat here again.
Simply because I've never been so sick.

It's a shame though, because on the way down, the lobster tail had these cajun seasonings and really was exceptionally delicious.

HOWEVER
I contacted Ruths Chris and they refunded my dinner amount, paid my hospital copay, and were SOOO nice and accomodating to my every demand.  Bravo.

Although, Boo for almost killing me.

Eh, I'm torn.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Stopped by after work to take a look around and I have to say I love the concept.  A little too tired to give it a proper taste test today but likely heading back tomorrow or Sunday to further investigate F.A.M.E.'s nightmarket concept is without a doubt something new to The Strip and with skewered meats, dim sum, stir fry, dessert, and even a permanent Fukuburger Truck with late night hours I can definitely see this place serving as a change of pace from the largely corporate offerings of The Linq dining while also serving up some excellent grub for late night revelers not entirely sober enough to drive to Spring Mountain.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Best Korean food in AZ. I've been waiting for a restaurant worthy of the East Valley Korean title belt; hodori and chodang always fell a bit short. GOGI has finally satisfied my need!

I went with a group of friends last night and we had the soon tofu, haemul pajun, bulgogi, assorted caviar stone rice bowl, and bibim nengmyun (buckwheat noodles). We also had the sushi which was all very fresh. The food was all great. And the unlimited sides were all yummy too.

I would definitely recommend this place and be coming as a regular.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Amazing Italian! This place just opened up in our neighborhood, Dobson Ranch, and the family owned atmosphere was comfortable and clean. The menu is all Italian fare, complete with the best homemade Chicken Parmesan I've ever had. We happened by their first day open, the service was smooth and friendly, I never would have known it was their first day! All that being said, give it a try and don't pass on the garlic knots!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This Burger King is nearly right across the street. Since my husband prefers this fast food joint to McDonalds, we do stop here every once in a while. Their food seems consistent and sometimes you have to wait a long time for your stuff, but it's almost always hot and fresh (can fast food be fresh?) 

I don't really eat here. I can't stomach most fast food. However, I like that I can get a 20 oz. Coke slushie here for just a buck. That makes me feel better when I have to make a special trip for one of the boys. My kids will eat anything you give them so I can't count on them for an accurate description of taste. 

The major reason why I'm writing a review is because of the customer service. A lot of times our food is just plain wrong. A lot more times they make you pull around the front so they can bring it out to you when it's done. We've had to wait upwards of 20 minutes for food before. Granted, it was 10:30pm, so I'll not be taking it too hard on them. 3 Stars because I've not had anything go so wrong as to not be back.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Hi, my name is Alicia and I have a migraine. In fact, I've had one for 7 straight days. My wonderful doctor just wrote me two prescriptions so I can kick the pain in the pants. Groovy. Prescription Drop-Off = No problem. 15 minute wait? I can swing that. What's another tick, tick, tick of the clock as my head throb, throb, throbs. 

I mosey around the aisles. Nice. Latex gloves on sale - 3 boxes for $10. Oh, look, espresso chocolate. 

Tick, tick, tick. 

45 minutes later without my name called over the loudspeaker (bummer), I head to the Pick-Up. I'm anxious for my meds. It's been a long day anyway, and this is the final stop. Or so I thought. 

I take a seat and stare at the floor. After all, the overhead lights hurt my eyes. I glance up and the pharmacist smiles at me. That's pleasant. I continue to wait.

"What's the name?" I answer her. 

That's when I hear they have 3/4 of my prescription ready but that one drug (my drug of choice to tackle the migraine) is out of stock. Would it be okay if I waited until Monday? 

Uhmmm... 

My mind flashes back to another Walgreens on another day when I'm waiting - in agony, mind you, after oral surgery. I want my narcotics like the children of rock wanted their MTV. I was told they were out, and I'd have to wait... or take my carcass to another pharmacy. I opted for the latter, for the claw marks in my palms were evidence enough that I couldn't stomach this pain any longer. 

So, needless to say, when I was told by this particular Walgreens that they were out of my gonna-make-your-boo boo-all-better meds, I had an emotional hiccup. WHAT? 

Count up the minutes. One hour in this stinkin' Walgreens and I'm really no better off than when my peds walked through the front door. Double ugh. Why couldn't they have called my name over the loudspeaker like they said they would? Then I wouldn't have waited in vain. 

Stupid pharmacy. I want my drugs!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The Good:  Who doesn't like A&amp;W root beer.  Hey if you are anywhere near this joint there are not many food options so this might be a good choice.  Basic fast food, blah blah blah.  I went with a crispy chicken sandwich, okay, nothing fancy.  They do have a root beer tap and serve you your root beer in a frosted mug, this alone is worth going here.  Oh yeah, grab a root beer float too, you'll take me later :D

The Bad:  Slim pickings here.  If you don't go to a mom and pop place around here then I would say go here.

The Ben:  Sure the refills are free, just make sure you are close to a restroom.  Same rules apply here as to real beer, once you break the seal it's game over.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Four stars with a caveat, DO NOT ACTUALLY GO TO THE RESTURAUNT,---ONLY ORDER BY PHONE!  

Inside is way nasty, it's old, kinda dirty, with an old man sleeping in a chair in the next room, etc. etc.

Food was very fresh, full of vegetables and the chicken and shrimp were both better than PF Changs, IMHO.  I'll order by phone next time and forget that I ever went inside that place.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I am a huge pizza fanatic. I've probably  eaten at over 40 different pizza places in Vegas. (I've lived here for over 25 years.) This place have the best stuff pizza in town. If you like Chicago style,the ones here are pretty good too. The reason i only gave it 4 stars is because their regular crust pizza here is only ok,but their Chicago style and stuffed..are truly to die for.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is the second of two Mathers pubs in Edinburgh, although as this one is in the West End I would say it's probably the slightly classier one (take that description with a pinch of salt, this is definitely not a 'classy' pub). There is a well stocked bar with a good selection of malts and ales that won't cost you an arm and a leg. The pub has a few tables dotted about, but most of the clientele stand (perhaps sitting is for wimps and girls?). Mathers is perfect If you're looking for a traditional, no frills pub - just remember to leave your pretensions at the door.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I am so sad to see that short leash will only be temporarily in this location! The service is great and the food is even better. I do not eat beef or pork but their chicken and veggie dog are the best I've had! I would recommended one of those with the sunny option, sans the prosciutto. I hope they will consider staying longer!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place is the best in town. Great hookah, great food, and great music! $13AYCS with no timeframe. Considering they just re-opened about a month ago, everything is stabilizing greatly! To reply to the negative comment for this lounge, the security HAS to check everyone's ID regardless if it's listed horizontal or vertical. I wouldn't want to risk anything with people under the age of 18 trying to get in if it was my business especially with how easy it is to get a fake ID in Las Vegas. So props to the security for doing their job correctly and not half ass. 

Also, the old spot didn't go under water. Smoken Vegas offered them a price for their old spot they couldn't refuse. And they brought back Sitara because SOOO many people were upset that it was gone in the first place! This is surely positive signs that they were doing fantastic that multiple parties were requesting a come back. 

You can totally tell that EVERYONE always has a good time. For crying out loud, there are regulars already considering they re-opened a month ago! It's the talk of the town for a reason! The comeback is definitely strong. Anyone who lives in Las Vegas or are visiting should definitely hit this place up!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I love this place! They are at a great location and are open for most of the day. They sell a wide variety of basic "grocery food" along with making their own food. They sandwiches are amazing! Plus many of their items are from other Wisconsin business. I would highly recommend going here to get great food or just to stock up on some food items!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I recommend TNB burger , NOT YOUR MAMAS  MAC , Mushroom bruschetta. Don't forget the bacon jam to go jar if they still have any left, it's good with any dinner or Hawaiian rolls or even for morning toasts.  I'm so glad I had bought some from Vegas to San Diego !   Now I'm craving the chips &amp; hummus 
Ok this means another trip to Vegas for me :). I wish we have cafés like this in SD ,</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Stopped in here just this morning, and it turned out to be their first day. Those of you familiar with Kim's Noodles know the space. Rosie's is doing some good things with it--including a fireplace nook that appears to be waiting to be loaded with books. The bar has been turned into a, well, coffee bar. 

The coffee itself was delicious. That is always an important thing for me, and this was as good as any downtown coffee shop. I grabbed a box of donuts, which were a hit with staff here at work. I'll have to try other items soon. 

They also do cakes for special occassions.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I ordered pork+kimchi and chicken+zuchini dumplings. The dumpling wraps were very chewy (they make their own wraps) unlike the stale store-bought dumpling wraps. 

The meat fillings were very tasty. I rarely eat out in Waterloo because most, if not all, restaurants put way too much salt and MSG in their food (like you would feel very thirsty after meal and gross out because of too much oil in the food).

But not in this dumpling place. Without MSG, their dumpling fillings were still flavorful and juicy (especially the chicken+zuchini one). The flavor was not too strong and felt like home made.

I also had a seafood congee, which was surprisingly full of fresh seafood. There were at least 3+ fresh scallops in the bowl and tons of mini shrimps. The congee was creamy and not watery. The congee soup base was made up of fish head soup.
And of course, no MSG. 

However, I was hoping that there would be more soup/juice in the dumpling fillings. But again, given their restaurant is quite clean, the owner is very friendly, and the food is indeed healthy, I would definitely come back again.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I heart my NJ and RI diners, so it is really a 3 1/2, but for not being a super cheezy national chain, I am adding on the 1/2 star chunk.

Ended up here for some food around 11pm on a Monday after realzing after some (okay, MANY) cocktails that delicous vegetarian fare was now out of the question in Phoenix and I frequent the Jack in the Box near my homestead a bit too much. We taxi-ed it to 5 &amp; Diner since I hadn't been there yet anyway. 

I liked the interior, although the temp was freezing, we got a corner booth and our waitress was simply kick ass. I had to put together my "breakfast before bed" from scratch and she totally nailed it for me (yay vegetarian and lactose-intolerant!). I noted there was outdoor seating as well.

 I remembered everyone mentioning the milkshakes and I surveyed the diner and everyone totally had one. :(. Jealllouuuus.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>OK, I'm gonna take one for the team and admit it.  Is it bad that I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place?  No judging now.  

I mean, I usually reject any restaurant remotely chain-like, but Cheesecake Factory, you are one of a handful of respectable chains that I like and frequent.   

An easy solution when you don't know what you want to eat (you're sure to find something in the menu, yeah, it may take 40 minutes to decide, but whatever), or want to take Aunt Dorothy and Uncle Charlie from the Midwest somewhere fun, but not too edgy or Scottsdale-like.

Funny thing is I've had their cheesecake maybe about two times, because with the ridiculously large portions would I really have any room?  And if you're looking to totally WRECK your diet, this is your place - there's hardly anything healthy on the menu (but they did just start a lite salad menu).  My favorite appetizers are the avocado egg rolls and the sliders.  Grilled shrimp club, BBQ chicken pizza, blackened chicken sandwich,  chicken chipotle pasta, chicken romano, and chicken madeira are all REALLY good.  I guess I like chicken, huh?

FYI, they don't have a kids menu, which is really DUMB, because this place is such a family restaurant.

For those who care, they have Valet.  I mean, come on, really?  There is a parking structure on the other side of Macy's.  Valet in Phoenix with easy parking situation = lame.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>So the three stars are for the cream puffs itself.  The pastry is light and airy with the exterior being nice and flaky and the original vanilla filling is not overly sweet.  Perfect for those with Asian dessert tendencies.  The two stars missing are due to the chaotic service.  It took 15 minutes to get our order.  Other people who ordered after us were receiving their orders first, since they don't seem to have a good system track and fill orders.  The other really annoying part is that the music in FAME is so loud, the cashiers can barely hear the orders.  The flavors they currently have are original, cocoa, cookie, and eclair style.  This beard papa's here doesn't have near as many flavor options as the ones in Cali or Canada. Hopefully they work out their service kinks soon.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I'm a big fan of their sister places, but had never visited A Room in the Town, previously. It was a touch underwhelming.

Overall, we said: "A Room in the Town is a smart place, with good, attentive service, but the quality of their dishes doesn't match this. Take the pointless croutons out of the soup, and the glob of vinegar off the egg, and you probably had two good but unremarkable dishes. I've always enjoyed my trips to their William Street place, but can't say the Dundas Street branch made such a positive impression. Maybe I'll pop by to try their dinner menu, at some point, as I like the set-up and suspect the kitchen is capable of producing better dishes than I was served, today."</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This is a gorgeous little deli, tucked away on Lochrin Place, serving the most delicious and incredibly strong coffee with a selection of tarts, cakes and pastries to go. It's filled with pretty unmatched polka dot and floral tablecloths, which adds to its quirky charm.

I visited today and treated myself to a cafe au lait and a brioche to take away, which came to a very reasonable £2.25. Incredibly strong and incredibly delicious coffee, to the very last drop. What I loved most about this place is the customer service, displayed as the staff chatted away to a lovely lady, who was dressed up with full hair and makeup, for a wee afternoon to herself filled with coffee and cake, while the staff conversed with her like an old friend. A charming and delicious deli.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I have a feeling this place usually has better service, but a sudden downpour sent everyone to Dexter's at the same time for their Fish Fry. So we waited...and waited...and a good hour later our fish came out. Folks who ordered to-go showed up only to sit there for a half hour and, well, wait. They got visibly cranky.

The beer battered cod is really good, so are the waffle fries, and the beer guy/owner(?) is definitely uber passionate about what he has on tap...just wasn't a good night for service. 

Don't expect anything nice, this is just a small bar/restaurant full of Eastsiders looking for a great micro-brew and some good fish.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The Fortitude Coffee would be ideally describet in German "klein aber fein" (small but fine) and everything would have been said about it.

Situated on York Place between the National Portrait Gallery and the famous The Stand Comedy Club, this café is bound to be a sophisticated little Island of caffeine and sugar. Normally I am not a fan of chain merchants but Fortitute takes the effort to make you feel like in a unique space.

 There is actually only very little space. Three tables, one round one and two smaller ones attached to the wall may sit 8 people comfortably, so it feels more intimate and offers some breathing space for you to sit and calm down from whatever you have been doing before you came here. 

The coffee is REALLY good, they also sell several blends to take home. They also offer a little cake selection, again, a small amount yet big in quality.
Definitely my a new top café for me :-)</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>As a beginner/novice dancer, I am usually intimidated by the social dances that I go to. So much that I sometimes just stand in the corner and watch. At the Stomp I went to (well, it was actually my first time at the event!) this month, I did not feel out of place very much and had an enjoyable time.

Stomp is a monthly themed event for the (swing/lindy) dancing community. Dressing up is encouraged. There is usually a lesson prior to the actual dance. The dancing area is large and spacious enough, with tables and chairs surrounding the hardwood floor for people to sit and relax. Music is "swing only!" and ranges from a variety of eras.

If I had a suggestion, it would be for them to advertise more. For instance, I only found out about the guest instructor workshops that occurred during this month's event only a few hours before the workshop from a friend. Unfortunately too late for me as I had plans that afternoon, plus I did not know if it was "beginner friendly".

PS You can find more updated (better?) info on Stomp at their FB page: https://www.facebook.com/SaturdayNightStomp</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Ok Mexican like everywhere else. I completely agree with the previous reviewer, "when is the authentic one coming to this town?" The menu cover page says it's authentic, but the men items themselves looked little more tex-mex ish. I had a fajita plate while my friend had a chicken dish (I forgot what it was called). My fajita arrived on a sizzling hot plate (that's takes care of the "fun part" regardless of the quality), and it was pretty good. The portion was huge, so I had to take ha;f of my plate to go, and the take out became the perfect left-over dinner next day.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Loved this place and will be back again! So nice to have a new, different, choice in the neighborhood.  The staff was really nice and showed us how to order, add items in our hot pot, and made suggestions from the grill.  The grill items are like sushi or tapas in that they are small, economically priced, portions, and you can try a bunch.  We went nuts, had a beer, and still had a very reasonable check.  Our 8-yr old boy was with us too and they were great to him!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Went here for a late dinner. The atmosphere was stylish and cool looking and while the lounge couches and little tables may look hip they are super annoying to try and eat at. The tables are so low you're practically bending over at the waste to eat.

The food was great. It was upscale/hipster Mexican food. The service was terrible. 

First, I asked for a glass of wine and some water and they brought out my partner's drink but not mine. When I asked another waitress about it, our waitress came up behind her and was kind of snarky about it. Um, it's not my fault, so don't be rude.

Second, my cousin ordered a glass of sangria and not only was it terrible, they charged her $14 for it instead of $6 like the menu says. When she questioned the waitress she got super rude about it. In the end the manager adjusted the price but it left a negative impression on both of us.

Terrible service. Food is good though.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>At its best the Bristled Boar is a great place to go with friends for an after-work drink or three, and maybe a game of pool or darts or just watch the game.  At its worst it is the epitome of a townie joint.  I've seen both over the last five years.  When I first visited the Boar it was a dive.  My college roommate had a job tending bar and we would from time to time take up his offer of free drinks in return for keeping him company.  The barstools were often filled with the usual regulars, drinking under a thick pall of smoke.  There is a certain charm to dive bars and I'm sure for some the old Boar had it, but not for me.  

Fortunately the owner completed renovated the entire bar, and this happened right about the time I moved out to MIddleton.  In place of the dingy walls was stylish wood paneling and tile floors instead of linoleum.  The ceilings were raised and the ventilation was improved, and while it can certainly still get smoky my eyes don't burn anymore.  There is a sand volleyball court out back and bar leagues during the summer.  The jukebox is relatively standard, but there are a few gems tucked in amidst the usual country &amp; hard rock options.  The regular crowd is still around, but a good deal more young people can be found at the Boar these days.  Some nights are vibrant and fun, some not so much.  I can't say that I've tried much of the food.  I know from my old roommate that there is a small grill in back, which was added during the renovation.  The Emil's pizzas are good as always.  All in all the new Boar is a complete improvement over the old one.

There are still a few things that keep the Boar from being my favorite in Middleton, namely the tap selection.  I am a beer snob and proud of it, so when the only local tap option is Spotted Cow I call foul.  I can't think of another Middleton bar that doesn't have at least one Capital tap, or at least Esser's Best.  What really seals it for me is sometimes the Spotted lines aren't even clean and the beer comes out flat and a bit funky.  Another complaint that I frequently have is some of the bartenders know next to nothing about proper drink mixing.  It is usually the same bartenders that act put upon to even mix a drink as opposed to just grabbing a bottle.  Some of the older bartenders are very good, but you almost have to know the schedule to avoid the others.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>These burgers!! These sides!! These people!!! ALL WONDERFUL!!!!

Flavorful, moist and fresh beef burgers served up casual by people who treat you like an old friend! 
The potato salad is so wonderful and creamy... It could rival your great granny's famous recipe! 
THE BAKED BEANS!!! Holy cow! They have a little bit of seasoned pulled pork spliced in with the tangy, sweet sauce and tender beans. 
Many, many great beverage selections to accompany your meal, as well as great old fashioned candies to delight the kid in everyone.
Right on the main drag of downtown chandler!
Eager staff who know how to please their customers, paired along with adorable artwork and tasty eats makes this place a MUST!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>You may think this is a cop out... writing a review of Starbucks. It's like writing a review of water. ("It's wet, delicious and necessary to my survival!") 

My aim is simple here though. This particular Starbucks location is an excellent place for people watching. Try hanging out there between the hours of 11am and 1pm on a Friday afternoon and tell me you aren't entertained by some of the patrons who go in and out of the doors. While attending school, I was taking a screenwriting class and given the arduous task of writing descriptions of about 35 random people. Where did I go to write every single one of them? Park Central Starbucks. 

The crew here is also super friendly every time I come in and they do their best to remember my name. It doesn't help that I tell them a different name every time. OK that's not true, but what a fun social experiment that would make.

The coffee... been there, done that and there's not much else I can say about it, but for the sport of people-watching, this a great place to hang out in the corner and just take it all in.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I go back and forth about this place. On one hand, there are some really great things. I love building my own sandwich at Duck and Decanter because they have so many great things to spruce up your order. You can add so many extras to your sandwich to make it delicious. Russian mustard, plump juicy avocados, turkey salad with blue cheese, sharp cheddar spread? Yes, please! They also have great fresh brewed iced tea every day in a variety of unusual flavors. I'm an unsweetened iced tea junkie so I love this.

On the other hand it takes a really long time to get your food and sometimes it tastes so blah despite putting a crapload of extras and sauces on it. Then it costs like $10 because you had to add all the extras for flavor. Shouldn't flavor come free?

I think it should.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We have been waiting a long time for Oreganos in Cave Creek. We have been patrons since opening day in old town Scottsdale 1993. You will have a wait but the food and atmosphere is well worth it.  The stuffed Número One-o has been a favorite from the start. If you can handle the wait, you'll love the food and be a fan forever.

    <review:review_text>Very good food. Nice atmosphere. Very good prices. The only thing i did not like was the time it took for the food to come. But once the food did come it was good. This is the old pasta palace. But redone. It is a little off the strip, but worth it. Good odds gambling and good food are what i look for when i come to vegas. This station casino has both. If you have a car and want good italian food at a good price come here. I am a picky eater and like this alot.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I'm beyond exciting to see the first Honolulu Cookie Company store outside of Hawaii. These taste so amazing and with single packed cookies they are perfect for gifts. Coconut dipped in white chocolate is my favorite but I've never had a flavor I didn't enjoy. The best part is that they allow you to sample all the different kinds in the store as well. Here is to a great company with a wonderful product and tremendous staff!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We were walking from MGM to Aria and Cosmopolitan and made pit stops at every place that had alcohol along the way and making new friends at every stop. This was one of our last stops. My friend was holding a cup and he was like "here! Try this!  It's like apple pie!" He was right.

Somehow, we ended up with 5 of the Sin City Ciders for free. I'm pretty sure they were from one of our new-found friends. They have a lot of tasty frozen alcoholic beverages here. But the Sin City Cider has got to be my current favorite. It has Fireball and cider...it's like dessert with a kick...on the head. Next time, I'll get a yard. Yum!

Everyone in our group was totally trashed and surprisingly, I wasn't. I figured out which new-found friends bought our drinks as I saw her faceplant while we were on the walkway from City Center to MGM and Metro was mean-mugging her instead of helping her get up. Shame!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Today we are craving fried chicken.  I am not a big KFC fan, but my hubby wanted to try it and they were having a bucket sale, so we stopped in.  Why this location?  We just happened to be on that side of town.

We got the bucket deal, half regular recipe and half extra crispy.  We got two sides, biscuits and drinks  The food came out quickly, was fresh and nicely cooked.  We enjoyed the meal and had left overs for lunch the next day.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Punk Rock Bowling could have been so much better...

The only reason I am giving this event a 3-star rating is because of their poor, sad excuse for a will-call line outside of the El Cortez in which I stood for 2+ hours on Friday night. Whoever decided letting in 15-ish people at a time into the Cortez to retrieve tickets must have been on acid. Also, the three or so girls working the tickets was insane. Four people to give out tickets to a show that spans an entire weekend?

Look, I'll be honest I stood outside for 2 hours and still did not have my two tickets to the ONE show I wanted to see (which by the way had already opened its doors that night). I got so frustrated I walked down to the venue and asked if it was really necessary I have my tickets to get into the show. I did have my email printed out stating I had paid for the tickets. They said I absolutely had to have the tickets to get in. GREAT! I returned back to the Cortez and basically walked in and non-nonchalantly stood in line behind the people who had been ushered in from outside by the seedy rent-a-cops policing the event.

I got my tickets and ended up seeing the show I had been looking forward to for some time. Azul Tequila had a good venue, and even with the clusterf!ck way of getting tickets everyone was in good spirits once actually getting into the show. Luckily punks tend to let things slide and then have a good time. I did the same.

But PLEASE PRB - get your act together about the ticketing system next year! I think the downtown location is great and it should stay there, but a new ticketing system must be put in place.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Decided to check out this place.  Not disappointed.  Hummus was excellent. Ordered a combo of chicken and  beef. Tender and not over cooked.  The rice was fluffy and tasty.  The chef came by and brought me a taste of his homemade baklava. I'll be back!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We just ate here last night.  They seemed to be pretty busy - there was a party they were preparing for upstairs.  We were seated in the bar/dining area.  I loved the traditional middle eastern music playing in the background.  The food was good.  The Lamb Kebab was very tender however it didn't seem to be seasoned very much.  I still liked it though and we ate it all along with the rice, vegetables and hummus it came with.  We also had the spinach/lentil soup which was very tangy and reminded me of Gujarati Dal.  The Date Salad was really good too - tangy and sweet.  I also tried one of their red wines from turkey and it went perfectly with our meal.  I'd love to go back and try more food and even catch a belly dance performance!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I love almost everything about the Middleton location. Big tables to study at or meet friends, great selection of wine and beer, free internet access and busy enough to not feel strange but slow enough that you can almost always get a seat. Also their wine tasting is a lot of fun and interesting when I want to play adult for a night. The only downfall is that the service can tend to be somewhat indifferent to you standing behind the counter. Overall a great place.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Oh how I miss the days when China Village was good. Don't even bother going here now. The meat is hard to chew threw, the fryer way too hot, and every dish uses the same bland brown sauce. The orange chicken was the dish I always got, but the poor thing as been reduce to a plate of grizzly, overly deep fried, dog meat with some orange sauce on top. Trust me. Don't waste your money here. I'm actually surprised they are still open!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Fresh and Easy is exactly what it claims to be... Fresh food, easy to buy. Prices are kept low by limiting the overhead, you will not find any baggers here so be prepared. The self bagging policy has never been an issue for me, Fresh and Easy isn't the 'let's spend $200 on groceries' type of store but it's great for picking up a few items you need for dinner that night, or for the weekend bbq you are planning... 

The pre-packaged, Fresh and Easy brand foods are usually pretty tasty, there have been a couple items I wouldn't get again but the mango salsa isn't one... I LOVE that stuff. The rosemary seasoned potatoes are a quick and yummy side dish. Watch for deals on produce, premade salads and baked goods... They get marked to half off a day or two before they expire.  

The employees are Fresh and Easy are very pleasant and ready to help if you need it. I am usually given a coupon when I am checking out for $5 off $20, can't beat that.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I was so jazzed and excited to finally have a brewery in the west side! I've been following Freak'N Brew for a long time. They were supposed to open a while ago, I think they had a lot if red tape to go through to finally open. 

Well my friends and I made the trip to come here this past Saturday night. Finding it can be a little hard. It's in an industrial warehouse complex just west of the 101.  After passing many buildings I saw a truck with the Freak'N Brew logo and knew I was there.  There was a small sign on the door and a paper tapped to the door that said open. 

Coming inside I was a little put off. First off the tasting room is super small. That's why it's called a tasting room, but what I didn't like was that it felt like an office complex waiting room. At least there is one TV and there was room at the bar for us to sit. I would have preferred they knock down the walls so we can see the tanks from the tasting room. Give it a real brewery feel. Oh well, to each is own just my two cents. 

We ordered the taster flight. It was $10 for 6 different beers. They had. 3 versions if their Belgium pale ale. Each with different hops. That was my favorite if the bunch but I thought it was a little weak, at under 5% alcohol. I'm more of a IPA fan and I like them in the 6-7 % range. 

After trying all the beers I really wasn't impressed. But that a personal preference. I'll totally give them more chances because I know they do brew IPAs, they just didn't have any today. As with most new breweries it takes a while to get everything working and to get more beers. 

If anyone reads my reviews I'm a huge fan of breweries and huge supporter if local AZ beer. So for that reason I will come back and support Freak. I doubt they will knock down walls, but the service was great, people in the tasting room seemed happy, and the owners came out and thanked us for coming by. For those reason I will be back!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>It had been a good 5 years since I tasted a quality stuffed pizza.  The Chicago pizza shack vibe was great with their wall of fame and all that although I wondered why there wasn't a pic of Harry Caray..maybe not appetizing to look at?

***Just a note to newcomers here...it takes about 45 minutes for them to make their stuffed pizza so you might want to call ahead of time before you go.  We will definitely do that next time.   The pizza was delicious.  We got a small pepperoni and mushroom and were only able to eat 2 slices a piece.  Had a whole half pie left over!!  

I'm always into checking out what everyone else is ordering.  Seemed like the thin crust was the most popular.  All of the pastas dishes looked huge and awesome so it would be fun to bring a group here next time to sample a few things.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Not worth it, though the idea is appreciable. Taste is not that good, its average or below average. People dont have options, and the shop is trying to fool it seems. Samosa chat that we ordered was not upto the mark.. Mango mastani also tried but it was also not living upto its name. Definitely not going to visit anymore the options that have on the list excites you but needless to say it disappears when you taste it.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I don't know what it is about this place, but they are slooooooooow. The food is adequate (please don't lecture me about fast food, why are you even reading this review?), but sitting at the drive-in will shorten your life. Or maybe just feel like it. 

I prefer some of their stuff to McDonald's (yes, I'm very discerning) but just cannot abide the wait.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Food: had an arugula prosciutto pizza with white sauce. I added caramelized onions which were nicely done. The crust was very good. Apparently they import their flour from Italy. Good flavours over all.My friends were also happy with their pizzas as well.  We shared the dolce banana dessert between 3 people and were very happy.

Service was reasonable. 

Location is good but the layout is a little weird. It had similar problems lay out wise as the previous restaurant there. 

Child friendly atmosphere. Kids get free gelato with their order. 

Moderately priced. Our pizza was about $16  each. I had leftovers to take home. My Italian soda was $3. Dessert was $9 but large enough to share with three adults and a good amount for each of us.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>It was a rare for me that during my college years of blossoming into manhood that I didn't start my night by a trip to Walgreen's. It was also rare that I didn't traumatize the clerk with my purchases.

During the period of time when Keith Charles was known as " Whiskeysaurus Rex" or "Bad Fritz"  and it was common that the following items were being purchased prior to a big night out on the town.

1. Glow Sticks
2. Condoms
3. Met Rx Protein Bar with 32 grams of whey protein isolate
4. Altoids- Cinamon
5. Marb lights
6. Monster Energy Drink (low carb to keep my girlish figure)
7. Motivational stickers 
8. Spare lighter
9. Cherry flavored chap stick
10. Plastic hip flask
11. Corn cob pipe (merely for style)
12. 1 liter of Bubble Gum flavored Pedialyte 

With all of these item stowed safely in my man bag, or "murse" I was ready for any adventure that the night may hold.

Now I know that major corporations are horrible for small business and are generally bad, but where else can a list like this be purchased with one stop ?

Hauki !

Light blue trojans please
Spermicidal for the win !
Do I need road flares ?

Talent ? When you are carrying the above listed items all in one basket, women tend to avoid making eye contact with you, thus making talent hard to judge</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>My boyfriend &amp; I went here for the first time yesterday since it opened. It opened very recently &amp; is very close to the gym we workout at, so we thought we'd give it a try. I'll admit, it wasn't the best experience we've had, but we've also had worse. 

We walked in &amp; was greeted by one of their waiters saying that we can take a seat wherever we wanted. I'd say it was a nice place, small but clean. Nothing too special about the interior. 

The service however wasn't up to par. Our order was taken by a Hispanic gentleman. In no way am I racist, but that language barrier can really be difficult to overcome. My boyfriend &amp; I noticed that when we took our order &amp; the order of other customers close by. The staff was friendly, but I believe they were not trained well enough just yet. 

Our order took much longer than expected. We ordered their Shrimp Spring Rolls as an appetizer, I got the Beef Pho, &amp; my boyfriend ordered the Salmon Curry. The spring rolls came out pretty quickly, as we would expect of a simple appetizer. However it took maybe 20-30 minutes for our entrees to come out. Unfortunately the owner had to come out from behind the kitchen &amp; ask us what we had ordered, since we were sitting there for so long. It turned out that our order was accidentally placed as to-go &amp; was just sitting there for a good while. 

What saved what seemed to be a very bad experience was that the owner gave our meal for free because it had taken so long to bring out. He was extremely apologetic about the whole thing. But enough about the service, on to the food. 

Shrimp Spring Rolls: They weren't the most amazing rolls out there, &amp; I'll be brutally honest, they were a bit plain. The shrimp to noodle ratio wasn't balanced. There was definitely too much noodles &amp; our rolls fell apart when we ate them. The peanut sauce wasn't all that great either &amp; wasn't spicy like the menu said it was. 

Beef Pho: The pho to me was one of the best I've had. It's up to par with Pho Kim Long, which is usually a long time favorite among me &amp; my friends. It wasn't like most places where it's a lot more broth than anything else. They didn't skimp on the noodles &amp; beef, &amp; the beef was seriously DELICIOUS. Some big pieced in there too. 

Salmon Curry: My boyfriend ordered this one. We were skeptical at first because the sauce for the curry was really runny. However the portion size of the salmon itself was actually a good size, better than most restaurants who like to serve smaller portions because salmon can be so expensive. But at only $11 for the salmon, side of broccoli, &amp; rice, we weren't complaining. The taste of the dish was a WHOLE differently story. It was SO GOOD. Even though the curry was runny, it tasted amazing. The salmon by itself was flaky &amp; seasoned perfectly. The combination of the two made for a very tasty dish. My boyfriend even liked the broccoli &amp; he HATES eating broccoli. Like with a passion. Needless to say, this dish will probably be a favorite of ours. 

Overall, the restaurant definitely has a to learn. Need to work on the service &amp; organization so that things don't get confused. But what they lacked in their training, they made up for in recognizing their flaws, learning from them, &amp; their tasty dishes. The owner was sweet, so I directly tipped &amp; thanked him for taking care of us. Considering they had just opened up, we weren't too hard on them, &amp; we assured him that we'll definitely be coming back for more.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Great little BBQ joint on the north end of Madison - emphasis on little. The place has perhaps a dozen tables, most only able to seat two. The decorating scheme is similar to a log cabin, with varnished wood walls and ceiling, and red checkered table clothes on the tables. The food is wonderful - the smoky aroma hits you as soon as you walk in the door. The half rack was delicious. The sauce is a traditional red, tangy and a little sweet. They also serve the sauce on the side if you order a pulled pork sandwich, which is nice.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>They have been open about 2 months in the New York New York Casino in Las Vegas.  MyVegas on Facebook just started offering a 2-for-1 deal, so I cashed in 5,000 Loyalty Points for a voucher good for $11 off.  They don't have a website or a menu on the casino website yet.  

There were about half a dozen sweet and half a dozen savory crepes offered.  We ordered at the cash register and picked up the food on the other end of the counter.  You can watch your crepe being made.

My friend chose the Breakfast Crepe and I had the Ham and Cheese Crepe.  The crepe was large and slightly doughy.  I'm used to a thinner, lighter, dryer crepe.

Next time we would order one savory and one sweet crepe and share the two.  We will be back.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The library is a nice, clean facility with good, diverse resources for patrons. However, there is no designated quiet area that is closed off from the noise/speaking that happens in the front of the library. There is a quiet reading room, but it is not closed off, so the noise easily travels back there. Additionally, there are hardly ANY outlets near tables, so if you need to study using a computer, you're quite possibly out of luck. Overall, I expect a quiet area to study in a library, and this one doesn't necessarily deliver. More outlets would also make it a better studying spot.</review:review_text>

This line is about a mile long but I don't mind  I have been impressed with all the locations on the west valley, so I am certain this will be no different. They have great coordination considering it's opening day and have all the vehicles lined up nicely through this business complex and staff is walking around handing out menus and pins :) so excited for this location!!

    <review:review_text>I was here for the 2nd day of their soft opening. The food is EXCELLENT. Although they are still working out ticket times, the wait staff were amazing. Amanda really knew her wines and wine pairings. 

The wine list is amazing and comprehensive. There are LOTS of wines by the bottle. I'd like to see more diverse wines by the glass, including another Zinfandel selection. 

The menu was that of a typical steakhouse with a variety of different cuts and sizes. I got the filet which was perfectly cooked. Beware - if you order a sauce they do not serve it on the side, they put it right on the steak. You can also get your steak cooked with a special rub seasoning too. 

Ordered some sides, including the wild rice, which was very wild! If you like unusual wild rice - go for it!

All in all, I see great potential with Rare Steakhouse. It is in a great location (across from the Capital), has great food, and good knowledgeable servers! 

I recommend this establishment and I will come back. Give it a try!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I thought the food tasted great. The staff was attentive and I am excited to have a good wine bar and have the large variety of Craft Beer.  My Turkey Panini was delicious, Ahi and Chicken entrée was enjoyed by others at my table.  

Since we were there during the soft opening, I wanted to give feedback:
-Maybe more varieties for bruschetta. We didn't get to try any, when we ordered ,we were told they ran out. 
-The Mac and Cheese had great flavor but hardly any noodles.  2 people at my table ordered it and were disappointed given the price.

We only intend to give feedback, not complain, because we know Unwined will be great, and the neighborhood needed a nice wine bar. We plan to visit often.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I love the concept of tapas and it's perfect for someone as indecisive as me whose eyes are bigger than their stomach. No matter what restaurant I go to, it always takes me an age to decide what to go for and the fact that I like pretty much about every food apart from mushrooms it doesn't make the choice any easier. Tapas is brilliant as it means I can try a whole bunch of stuff off the menu rather than just one main. I'm just back from Madrid and there's tapas absolutely everywhere, even in bog standard bars, it's awesome and I'm an even bigger tapas fan now than I was before. 

La Tasca has an excellent menu and they do an amazing patatas bravas and the two times I've been here the service has been of an excellent standard and the food even better.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>New businesses typically up their standards for grand openings.  If that's the case, Big Daddy won't be around for long.  This was, by far, the worst pizza I've had.  I was really hoping it would be at least as good as Little Caesers, as Big Daddy is more convieniently located.

We ordered a cheese pizza and a pepperoni pizza.  

APPEARANCE:  The pizza is quite small, as another reviewer stated. I believe it's equivalent to a Domino's medium pizza.  I also noticed the pizzas were much flatter than most others. It was hard to pull a slice out of the box.  It's common that we have to re-cut pizzas as they're usually cut in a hurry.  My pizza slicer would not cut thru this pizza.  It was like leather - my daughter has braces and was completely incapable of biting thru the crust.  She ate the stuff off the top. The pepperoni pizza had about 2.5 slices of pepperoni per slice - not enough for pepperoni in every bite.  Both pizzas were full of grease.

TASTE:  The sauce was good.  The grease made me think back to high school pizza (I graduated in '95).  I made a comment about high school pizza, and everyone else said "no, school pizza is better."  There was an adequate amount of cheese.

OVERALL:  Save your $5 and get pizza ANYWHERE else, seriously.  Go to Albertsons and get a frozen one to cook yourself.  Drive up Nellis and go to Little Caesers.  As convenient as this place might be,  it's just not even worth $5.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The taco gods heard my cries, what luck would I have to stumble upon John's review? I hopped in my car and head right over...same place different folks, they're a bit confused and it took some repeating to get my order placed but once placed everything was as I remember it 2 months ago when Dan was the front man....wherever you are I hope all is well and you will be missed.

I ordered my usual for my son &amp; self, asada taco, tostadas, and fish tacos....got home and they screwed up my tostadas - no meat, bean only..which I will call them about - one second thought maybe I won't there's no number listed.

Other than this mishap its back to business as usual over there</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Pizza by-the-slice, and it sucks.

The pizza crust is spongy and the rest of the pizza just lacks much flavor at all.  They have a "two slices and soda" lunch special which, if I recall correctly, is under $6.  If you just need to fill your gut with something ... why not?

It's just rather depressing that there's really no good place to get a decent slice in downtown Phoenix.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I tried so hard to like this place but the food--at least what I ordered--just wasn't very good.  I got the artichoke spinach cheese dip which came with flatbread and fresh cut veggies.  Sadly, the veggies (alone) were my favorite part.  A previous Yelper mentioned the tomato bisque as being something to try and I was super disappointed--it was just meh.  Wildflower and Cafe Zupas soups put it to shame.

Good things?  The restaurant itself is stunning--all brand new.  Lots of attentive servers=great service.  Fancy soda machines.  Decent prices.  The smoothie bar looked cute.  Ugh!  I feel like I'm fishing here...

I think I will be back again to see if I just had a bout of horrible ordering.  The breakfast menu did look promising.</review:review_text>

I'm not sure what was the most interesting: the local drunks at the bar, my rubbery bluegill fillets or the decor that time forgot or rather, abandoned. Good prices and service.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>How do I love Chipotle? Let me count the ways... cilantro rice (mmmm), fresh corn salsa, burritos as big as your head, prices easy on your wallet, funky industrial-Aztec decorating scheme, and hip tunes on the stereo. Beats the stuffin' out of the usual fast food joints. Who would've guessed that Chipotle is owned by McDonalds?</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>As per the previous review my boyfriend and I were also invited to the pre-opening night! He had explained to me the new concept they were going for with a list of ingredients as your menu and then a 'taster' type menu of 6 courses based on this. Well we weren't disappointed, the food was delicious and fresh, each course beautifully presented and service fantastic! I won't go into too much detail as the previous review has explained it perfectly! I recommend you give this place a try if you're open to different combinations of ingredients and would enjoy a surprise as each course arrives! Cannot fault anything and will definitely be returning! Have heard the price will be very amenable too for the quality of produce and number of courses you are getting :) a great new restaurant and innovative idea!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Having not been to a strip club in awhile, I had a blast with clients at Phoenix's most famous gentlemen's club.  $10/cover and $10/lap dances with friendly, gorgeous, well mannered entertainers made the night go way too quickly.

Highlights include a pair of Parisian identical blonde twins and a Brazilian angel who looked like she belonged on the cover of Vogue.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I wanted to like it, I really did. The Stamm House is walking distance from home, so I figured we HAD to try it... 

First off, let me say that the atmosphere is typical old(emphasis on the old)-school Wisconsin restaurant. Wood paneling, dated tables and chairs, and GOD AWFUL seventies music piped in. When we walked in(at six on a Saturday night) there was one couple at the bar, and another couple dining upstairs near us. The waiter seated us--close to the kitchen, I realized with disappointment. If I want to hear dishes clanging and the hustle and bustle, I'd be cooking at home. Dining out is for pretending that there's no work involved. It also didn't help that because it was so slow in the restaurant, I could hear every comment the waiter said to the cook-staff, some of which wasn't patron-friendly. 

The BF ordered the fried walleye,and I the beef tips Moutarde. His french onion soup was decent, but my salad was lacking. When the meal arrived, I was so excited because I was STARVED. I picked up a piece of beef with my fork and bit down into tender, juicy...FAT. Fatty fatty fatness. Ewww. I did the not-so-sexy-spit-it-onto-the-side-plate maneuver. All right. Every now and then you get a fatty piece of meat in a dish. A girl can move on. MY next bite was better, and although the sauce was decent, it was nothing fabulous. I was disappointed when my next piece was also quite fatty. You know when you get that cheap meat that is mostly sinew and fat. *Sigh* I'm done. I pushed the dish off to the side and settled for my potato. 

To give credit, the waiter noticed I wasn't eating the dish, and asked me if something was wrong. I told him, and he offered to get me something else, which I declined(by the time it was made, Chris would have been done with his dish). Later, he also offered a free dessert, which we really didn't want. He ended up knocking almost half off my dish, which was appropriate, I think. 

Over all, it just wasn't enjoyable. I could have gotten over picking a bad dish if the experience itself was nice, but it wasn't. Average at best. The waiter was decent and tried to be accommodating, but on the whole, it was just sub-par. I left wishing that I had picked another spot to spend my hard earned date-night budget! I realize that a place like this isn't going to be gourmet, but I've had MUCH better casual dining experiences...for less money!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Nice ambience and friendly staff make this a welcome addition to the New Town restaurant scene.


 A good quality, well priced wine list (including two rose when many places mysteriously only manage one)sets off well the food menu (half a dozen reasonably priced starters, 8 or so main courses leaning strongly towards the top of the £9 - £15 bracket, 3 cheaply priced salads, half a dozen medium priced side-orders and a handful of mid-price desserts (cheese £5.90)).


 My duck was melt-in-the-mouth tender and the ginger infused sauce a delight whilst the side order of green beans were cooked to perfection. Desiring more than one type of veg with your main dish could though start making thigs quite pricey so sharing is a good idea. The lemon tart with blackcurrant coulis was a pleasant dessert and the Spanish rose washed it all down well.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Wow, I'm surprised to see the negatives. We have had a good experience here.  Right now I am eating a veggie with so much lettuce I have a little salad on the side. cheeses and avocado are standard

We use all their services; delivery, internet pick-up and stop-in.  Fast delivery, GREAT pick-up, good stop-in. We always order online. The website is easy to use and gives all the options at the store with easy to select choices.  We do always go at night 

I also like the macaroni salad and I love the pickles. I wish I knew what kind of pickles or a similar pickle. I love them.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I give 5 stars but they don't always have my favorite flavor yogurt available. However even without my favorite froyo Swirls is the best frozen yogurt and ice cream place in Scottsdale. The staff is friendly and the rewards program is a great advantage. The owner whom I have met takes great pride in his store and is very personable. The store even had yogurt for your dog and a bowl of cold water for them to drink from if you decide to enjoy your yogurt outside. Swirls used to be yogurtology but I guess they changed their name, however as long as they serve fantastic yogurt I don't care what they name it. I'm in.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>If you have ever eaten at Los Favoritos, then you will love this place as it is the sister company/owned by the same people. Pricing is about the same as most taco joints, the tacos themselves run $2.00-$3.00 apiece and there is every type of burrito you can think of on their menu (my personal favorite, the sausage breakfast burrito...YUM). 

Of course, they also have combos featuring your typical Mexican fare, like chimichangas, chile relleno, tamales, etc. and the prices are pretty fair for what you get portion wise.

The facility is brand new, so it's clean and spacious and there's a decent amount of outdoor seating.

My favorite part is that they are family owned (they have several southwestern locations but are more or less "local"), and you can never go wrong supporting the little guy!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Oh Clary's!  For only $.99....I can get a me-sized "sampler" bag of popcorn.  My favorite is the lite oil/salt.....it's perfect...and healthy.  There are always samples of popcorn to try, so I make sure to sneak a handful of the kettle corn and cinnamon popcorn.  The thing that makes this place truly exceptional is the owner himself.  He always has a genuine smile for me and know exactly what I am going to order as soon as i walked in.  When I walked in after break, he told me he missed my smiling face while I was home for the holidays.  Love him, love the store.  5 big smiley stars!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>New, but not new. We were here before, but it was a different place.  Still Indian food, but apparently under new management. 

Upon entering the first thing that was obvious was they were very busy and most of their customers were Indian.  That's a good sign.

As with the previous place, the buffet still is very small.  There were perhaps 6 vegetarian items, and 6 "regular" items.  Except that included the desserts.  They didn't even ask if I wanted a menu, they just said to go to the buffet.  I get the feeling they don't like people ordering off the menu.

The food itself was good.  The goat curry you wouldn't know it was goat if it wasn't labeled.  It could easily have been beef (but wasn't, for religious reasons, I suspect).  The tikka was good also, and they had a rice dish  that was very tasty.  I think it was labeled as a mushroom rice, although I didn't notice any mushrooms.  But it was very nice.  They also had biryani, and it was good too.  All in all, the food was good.

They are a bit pricey.  Just under $10 for the buffet (weekday lunch).  And if I wanted a Coke it would have been extra (though they did have the real-sugar Coke).  When we were done paying the check was very inefficient.  They don't bring it to the table, you go to the register and tell them how many buffets, and then (eventually) get your credit card and run it.  I'm not sure what was going on, but the group in front of me had a conversation with the register person (owner??) that I couldn't understand, and it took a long time before he finally asked me how many buffets I needed to pay for.

As I said, the food is pretty good.  But for the price there are better Indian places.  Because of the YELP scale I have to rate one "$" (under $10), but it was just barely under $10.  It seemed pricey to me for a simple lunch buffet.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Great lunch spot near Costco and target.  We tried the buffalo chicken as well as momma's Mac &amp; cheese,  both were very good.  Open and airy location and they bring your meals to you if you are dining in.

We will return to try more things including the four cheese melt which I'm told is excellent.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Firstly, let me state that I'm a loyal pizza fun. I love grubbing on pizza, letting the melted cheese drip from my mouth, savouring the delectable treat. So when I saw Old Chicago which is located a few palrty miles (if even that) from my house, I shot through the top of my car.

I've never had the pleasure of visiting Chicago, so I can't compare notes. However, I was surprisingly pleased by the quality of the food. I ordered a deep dish pizza, and I loved every bite of it. Old Chicago has a decent drink menu, so if you feel like accompanying your pizza with an ice cold margarita or beer, I promise you won't be disapponted.

Service was great, food was great! Four stars for me.</review:review_text>

The portions are on the small side so dont get confused and order one plate to share (like other thai places) because you will starve, and the Thai Tea is really good but there is no refills (like other thai places)..but all in all ther food is really good, and the place is decorated beutiful</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Place was great the first time I went, Second time one of Dan's fair weather buddies (thinking he was big shooter) disrespected a good friend of mine over a misunderstanding that could have easily been solved through civil conversation, but he tried to be Mr. Big Shot.  

The food was good, but not good enough to put up with that crap ever again.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I heard from my coworkers this place just opened so I grabbed some take out before heading home after work. Place was cool, bartender and staff were friendly--not to mention waitresses were...um...muy caliente! I ordered the carne asada tacos, and although they had good flavor, they were greasy.  Chicken tacos were decent.  Prices for Taco Tuesday are definitely worth trying. Definitely better than El Hefe's tacos! I think Ricky's would be even better if they clean up the grease.</review:review_text>

You could make smores on their floor. Wow, that even rhymes. I'm thinking bumper sticker here people. Create your own box. With the nicest of nice ladies to help you. I mean really, they have to be amped up on sugar. What else is their to nibble on? Great service. Great candy. Great location. But where was the See's Candy professional to slap that 14th piece of candy out of my hand last night as I slipped into my my milk chocolate coma on my 600 thread count sheets, nearly drowning in my 1/2 inch pool of drool?

    <review:review_text>The dumplings are pretty good and are all handmade in the back. They have a limited selection daily so be sure to check with the front what dumplings are available that day. So far I've been here twice and have had the Deep ocean scaled fish dumplings and the Beef dumplings. Both were quite tasty. Each time I've gotten Combo #1 which is the price of congee+dumplings and they throw in a free dish of pickled vegetables. The dumplings come in two sizes (12 and 16 pieces). The framework of the business seems to built on their organic and fresh ingredients. You can also get the uncooked dumplings to go and as far as I can tell they're $1 off the cooked price minus the tax. 

Overall its always good to have more selection into he UW plaza and the addition seems to be quite decent this time. My only complaint is the speed... It takes over 30min to get your order! Hence I'm knocking off a star for an originally 4-star review. For reference I came in during rush hour dinner dine in and lunch take out.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Beard papa is a chain from Japan. They have tons of locations in Cali but now Vegas has one! It's here finally and inside FAME at the Linq. 

Prices aren't the same as Japan. They average about $1-$1.50 but here it's $3 for one. So I'm probably not going to frequent it as I do in Japan but maybe once in a while. If you've never had one then it's a definite must try!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>It's true that Edinburgh has more than its fair share of  'modern european' eateries. And there's no denying that this is yet another one to add to the list. But the plus side of this is that the competition among them means that the good ones are usually extremely good.

Iris is the newest addition to this collection on Thistle Street. Although their Á La Carte is a little too expensive for what it's worth (hence only 4 stars and not 5), their set lunch menu offers great value for money. I'd highly recommend their Mussel starter - it comes with toaste pine nuts, bacon and fresh basil cream. It'll have you racking up the hours in the gym in the days that follow, but it's so worth it!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I have yet to get a bad meal, or a messed up order from this place. Great food and staff, and yes Friday nights are PACKED, but with good reason... I mean, you don't get packed, or have return patrons time and time again if service and food is subpar.

Since under new management from the old "Desert Babes" last year, the owner has whipped this place into shape.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Coming to Clarinda's is a very welcoming, homely experience, and very much like sitting in the "good room" reserved for special occasions in your great-aunt's house, or somewhere similar, with old fashioned yet comforting decor and with a nice safe familiarity about it all. 

What's nice about Clarinda's is the non-pretension of it all, and that reassuring, some things never change feeling you get when you come here for a nice wee cup of tea, or a home made scone, or something equally as life calming.

I do feel a bit like I should keep my elbows off the table when I'm here and mind my Ps and Qs, but then again, I should probably do that wherever I am. The food here is so reasonably priced, and you get a lot of it too, none of these measly, recession friendly, food portions. There was nothing pretentious about my tasty sandwiches, which came with crisps and salad on the side, and I also managed to wolf down what I think was, or remember as, a yummy slice of banana loaf.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Had the Italian beef sandwich, dipped, with hot &amp; sweet peppers and fries. The food was made to order and tasty. I don't know that it is fair to compare it to Portillo's, as it holds a special place in my heart, but this place holds up pretty well in the comparison! I'm definitely going back!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>My first visit here and I love this place. I went in and got to spoke with Sabrina. Super nice gal and talked with me and my daughter about the different juices and nut milks. The prices are reasonable and the flavors they have are delicious.  I got Flush, Hemp Seed Milk with Spirulina, and Refresh.  The Flush is really yummy if you like ginger. The Hemp seed milk is creamy and delicious. It tastes kind of like a mild flavored chai or spice cake. Refresh has the green tea in it.  We will definitely be back.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Living downtown, there isn't much relief from the heat, so I was excited to hear that the Downtown grand was doing more than a typical hotel pool concept. The area features lots of cabanas, fake grass, table games, picnic benches in the shade, misters everywhere, a nice long bar, a DJ and a raised pool (on the small side). Tack on $5-6 brews, $7-8 cocktails and it makes for a nice place to have a drink with some friends. Not bad!

That being said... Warning!
When we walked in (Saturday @ 3pm), a security guard asked if we were hotel guests. When we said no, he was going to tell us to leave, but instead let us in when we said we were local and just wanted to see the place and grab a drink. I'm not sure if that means that it's OK to grab a drink here, or that this place will be for hotel guests only. 

As per their website: 
"Picnic Restaurant is open for lunch daily from 11am to 5pm.

Picnic area and pool facilities are open to hotel guests from 9am to 7pm and is offered as a complimentary hotel amenity.

Access to non-hotel guests is available with the purchase of our Picnic Day Pass, which includes the use of the facilities as well as a well cocktail or beer of your choice. Prices are Monday through Thursday $15 and Fri/Sat/Sun $25.00 per person"

If this is the case, drop this review down a notch. I can only review on what I experienced, which was free entry to a cool rooftop to have a drink. Let's hope it's always open w/o cover for a cocktail and a burger.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I try and stay away from Chinese fast food.  I don't know why... it's just who I am.  But, there are times that I can be purely lazy and have a hankering for some Broccoli Beef and steamed rice.  Anyhow, Panda Express is close and easy to get to.  So, here is my review of tonight's visit.:

 - I drive over to Sam's Town, which has the closest Panda Express to me.  I park in the 2nd parking lot, on the ground floor.

 - I walk in to the North East entrance and Panda is right there on the left. 

 - There wasn't a line and I ordered my meal.  I had to wait a couple of minutes as they were replenishing their stock.  So, I had fresh Broccoli and Beef.  Woo Hoo!!!

 - I paid and then left...  easy as that.  

My meal was okay but nothing to give it 4 or 5 stars.  With that said, it's an okay place to go if you are in a hurry and are too lazy to make your own rice.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We picked up some pizza to go from Rocky's on our way to House of Brews. The brewery, located a few minutes away by car, allows you to bring in your own food and it was a good excuse for us to revisit one of my childhood favorites.

Originally opened in Madison in the mid 70's, the chain has a mascot who's a reference to a character from the Firesign Theatre, a Los Angeles-based comedy troupe know for surrealistic humor on live radio programs and recorded albums.  The chain used to have restaurants all over the midwest, but now they're almost exclusively found in Wisconsin. The pizzerias really focus on their eccentric mascot, who looks like a Panamanian tailor in a fedora or a WWII propaganda piece against Italians. 

Stepping into Rocky's is a 1990s time capsule. Little has changed with Rocky's pizza in the past couple decades. They still have posters of Signor Rococo all over the place, they still sell square-shaped, pan style pizza with their signature Italian-spiced, meatball-sized sausage (among other possible options, although I prefer their sausage pizza), and they still offer butter-lathered breadsticks served in paper cups.  It's greasier than your average pizza and I don't understand why they throw a sheet of plastic over it inside the box, but it tastes and smells just as I remember it from birthday parties and school events.

I wouldn't go as far as saying Rocky's pizza is extraordinary, but it's definitely fun to revisit it and reenter an unchanged scene with all the same sights, smells and decor from 20 years ago.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>If you have been looking for a true hole in the wall Mexican restaurant for cheap tasty authentic Mexican cuisine, this is your place.  I must have driven by Juan's a thousand times on my way to work without ever noticing it.  It is a totally non-descript cinder block building with no windows or obvious entrances.  It's a little scary looking, especially since it is right next to the 51.  Trust me.  You need to check it out.  Inside is a bustling family run restaurant that feels like home.  The food is really good.  I have already been back several times since being introduced to Juan's by a friend.  It is destined to become a part of my restaurant rotation.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Hava Java will be missed by the naked eye barreling along Camelback, but I'm here to tell you that it's there. It's there to bring you fresh coffee and pastries and wifi, like most coffee houses do these days. The coffee is not too bad. Good place to meet someone on a coffee date, but the parking's a bit awkward since it's in another one of Phoenix's famous strip malls. The seating inside is a bit weird, so sitting outside next to the parking lot is a good choice as well. 

I'm still confused on the pronunciation of the name. Is it "hov-vah jov-vah" or is it a short "a" sound, for examples, as in the word "fashion"? Either way, you're pronouncing one of the words incorrectly, and that just bothers me. C- for grammar.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I have been driving by this restaurant for weeks wanting to try it and we finally did. Good thing we waited because it just opened this week! Very impressed. The food was delicious and the service was quick and attentive. The hot habanero salsa had a good kick to it and my friend even declared it inedible due to the spiciness so fortunately for me I got it all to myself. She also said the shrimp tacos were the best she's ever had. My boyfriend is a very plain eater and the restaurant was able to accommodate our request for a "plain bean and cheese burrito" with no hesitation. I will probably come back in the afternoon sometime for lunch when it's not so busy.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Since it changed from Sam's to Papa Sam's I have ordered them 3 times, 1 time we picked it up for lunch which was VERY GOOD, and two times for dinner delivered BOTH times it took forever and BOTH times the pizza looked like it had slid around in the back seat and it was cold and rubbery.....it's too bad the night shift sort of ruined the place for us!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Serves its purpose but nothing special. The location is across from a mall which makes it a good location to get food. To get to downtown is a $15 cab ride or perhaps a lengthy wait for a bus so keep in mind.

Rooms are basic but clean, and the lobby is spacious and modernized. The service is standard and more or less helpful. If you can get a good rate and dont need to be in downtown, this place will serve its purpose. 

Breakfast is $10 and is standard expanded breakfast. No live cooks though.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I love Thai food especially pad thai.  I am always searching for a good pad thai.  I finally found the BEST pad thai in Arizona!!!  On top of that the yellow curry, and spicy fried rice are very dilicious.  Their lunch is $7.95 comes with vegetable spring roll and salad (love the peanut dressing).  The place was very clean, the owners were very helpful, the food was excellent!   I definitely will come back and I recommend to everyone!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Overall a solid semi-gourmet burger joint, brand new inside the Palms!

It's located next to the Palms Pool, with indoor and outdoor seating RIGHT on the pool deck!

Prices are around $11 per burger...$6-8 per fry.  For the price and setting I was a bit disappointed that they would not cook my burger medium rare, and was told they ALL get cooked MW-WD.  Shame!

I went with the Barry Burger ($11): Smoked Bacon, Cheddar, Charred Red Onion &amp; Balsamic Ketchup on Sesame Bun. Good burger and still a bit juicy considering it was cooked medium well. It's missing a mayo/aioli in my opinion, but it's a solid burger with GOOD flavor in the toppings.  Towards the end, a large chunk of red onion dropped out, about the size of a GRAPE.  Attention to detail guys!!  Wasn't that busy today...

Blue Cheese &amp; Bacon Fries ($8). These were DELICIOUS and had tons of flavor...Recommended!  The portion was a decent size, and the flavor was very good.

And to finish, Vanilla Custard with Reeses Pieces ($6). Pretty good, just wish these were peanut butter cups...started getting ROCK hard towards the bottom.  The custard was thick and rich...I'd try the chocolate custard next visit though.

Overall, a SOLID choice inside the Palms!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I have to disagree with these other reviews. My husband and I frequent Dexters often and really love the place.
We haven't ever had a bad experience with the service and love the food (our faves are the waffle fries, pub chips and the burgers). 

The atmosphere isn't all that, but nonetheless it's a great little neighborhood pub with friendly bartenders, good food and great drink specials!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This fantastic cafe/deli just off Prince's Street has been open for over three years, and their menu is just mmmm...

I went in with a friend, and had the most fascinating conversation with the owner about countries of origin and the Uppsala film festival in Sweden! But now to the serious stuff, the foodddd.

They've got a large range of meat and vegetarian dishes, and the usual list of panini's with quite unusual ingredients! For example, the smoked turkey tomato cranberry was a bit of a novelty for me, but was quite delicious! They're quite affordable, and claim to use ZERO articial ingredients, so they win the health vote as well.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This great little market is right next to my house, so of course I had to check it out. The gentleman who works there is very friendly and happy to answer questions about different products. From what I can tell, there is a good variety of foods from all different Asian countries. They also have fresh ice cream and a relaxed atmosphere.   I'm looking forward to trying lots of things from here! Can't wait until they get some more varieties of mochi!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>My wife and I were invited to Aizle (remember, rhymes with Hazel) for their 'pre-open' night, and found ourselves to be the very first customers to walk through the door. 
Aizle has a new concept to dining, where the food is as fresh as it gets! There is no traditional set menu as their website explains, instead the husband &amp; wife (Stuart the chef and Krystal the mixologist) duo have the freedom to use the freshest ingredients from farms and suppliers. You are given a list of all the ingredients and where they come from, which is a great touch.
The restaurant is slightly rustic and modern, with cool chilled out music and very friendly staff. For a restaurant that isn't huge it does have a bar that you can sit at and try some of Krystal's own cocktails, there is a good size wine list, and finally a restaurant that hasn't stopped there but has added some decent beers for the beer drinkers. I had the Kindl Berliner Weisse, which is a fresh sour wheat beer and perfect with the fresh seafood that was coming out.
All the food that we ate came from a tasting menu, and was some of the freshest and tastiest we have had. The oysters were the best I have tried. The veal tongue was a new one and was gorgeous, the hake was so fresh and soft it still tasted like the ocean. One of the highlights for me was the pig's cheek, so tender and just melted in the mouth.

Can't wait to go back and take friends, and glad we will always be remembered as the first people to eat here.
Can seriously recommend it!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>After landing in PHX but before embarking on a 2.5 hour drive to Flagstaff, i thought Wendy's would be a safe and easy place to grab some food on the go...well, I was wrong.

* Chicken Nuggets: dry, freezer-burned meat with extra hard double-fried shell.

* French Fries: super hot, crunchy, over-fried french-fry-shaped fry-shells. so hard and crunchy that i thought i was eating french-fry chips.

* Junior Bacon Cheese Burger: bacon and burger meat both tasted dehydrated.

Guess what, last thing I want after a 4hr flight and landing in 100+ weather is hot, dry, crunchy, tasteless food!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Very nice new-ish PTs off 215 and Durango. Large bar, plenty of table seating and very spacious. Wasn't too smoky or crowded on a weekend night after work. Service was very good and food was decent. A great addition for drinks and grub in the area. I'll definitely be back for some drinks after those rough days at work!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Pleasance Theatre is THE place to be when the Edinburgh Festival is on in August.  For most of the year, Pleasance is used as a student union for Edinburgh University and it is good place to have lunch or to go to with friends for a drink.  

When the festival comes to Edinburgh in the August of each year, the Pleasance Theatre comes alive and it is always absolutely packed.  Although the venue is relatively small in comparison to the other Theatre's in Edinburgh, with a capacity of about 30, the queue's for going to see a show at Pleasance always stretch far back.  This could be in part due to the intimacy of the Theatre which makes it so popular with the festival goers.  However, with the intimacy comes one draw back - the place tends to get rather cramped and so it is a fairly sweaty experience!  But luckily there is a bar nearby to get drinks during a show.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>So, when I was much younger I went to Christos and it was the first place I had escargot.  I remember the good food and calm environment.  Sadly, it appears things have changed since I was a child.  I was with my parents and we arrived later then our reservations had claimed we would.  The workers were very nice and said they would try to fit us in the best they could.  People kept on walking though the door with reservation after reservation.  We waited maybe 15 minutes until we were seated.  After a short time our waiter came by and rattled through the specials.  Once he left we were unsure of what he actually said.  I knew before I arrived I would order some escargot and decided to go with some kind of halibut special.  The escargot came and did not taste as great as I had remembered.  It was all right, don't get me wrong but did not stand out.  Our meals came with salad and soup.  The salad had more then enough dressing, luckily the dressing was good.  The food arrived but did not impress.  The plate looked very plain with items not being placed in any nice manner. The halibut was slightly over cooked and did not have much flavor.  It was difficult to speak to one another over the many other loud conversations.  It would have been nice if the food was as good as I had remembered it.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>My new favorite restaurant.  They have 22 different fish dishes ranging from $16-23, at least a dozen different kinds of pizza slices ready for you to pick out of the case, soups, salads, and 15 kinds of pasta that they will serve with any of 4-6 different sauces.  The food is so yummy!  I rate it 5 stars because the menu is huge, it fits a niche market that is in need of more restaurants, the people are warm and friendly, food is all freshly prepared but the wait is not long, and it is reasonably priced.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>When it comes to food, basically an IHOP is an IHOP.  When you have a hankerin' for breakfast at 3 PM but you can't be arsed to mix up any pancake batter, you go to IHOP.  It's not the best stuff in the world, but it's cheap, fast, and when you're in the right mood it can be the perfect thing to sate you.

Anything located on Boulder Highway is special though.  Boulder Highway is like a little land that time forgot.  The sweet sounds of Journey and Kansas can be heard floating through the air.  The wait staff at this particular IHOP all have one thing in common:  A distinct lack of urgency.  Or quickness.  Or...well, caring.  I don't know if if was our lack of mullet, but my friends and I spent 2 hours there yesterday.  At 3 PM.  It wasn't full.  Two full hours is far too long to be in an IHOP.  

But hey, I got those pancakes I was longing for!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Two adults and one kid equals a 40 dollar meal.  It's not like we ordered everything on the menu either.  The kid had pancakes and a drink, the adults each had an omelet and one drink.  The pancakes were great, but the omelets were super salty, and the ingredients were the furthest thing from fresh.  The service was horrible.  They kept forgetting things, and it felt like they were trying to rush us out the door, even though there was only one other table there.  

Another reviewer mentioned having to walk through a service area, and it's true.  To get to the bathrooms you have to walk through a narrow service area that seems awkward.  The bathrooms were nasty dirty, next time I'll just hold it.  

To top it off I got food poisoning and spent the rest of the day suffering immensely.  

Thanks International House of Poop!!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Only had coffee here on multiple occasions...HOT ! 

Iced coffee was fairly good. 

Service was as expected and prices are close to those of the "high-end" chains you all know. However, I'd have to admit that under a blind taste test you'd have a hard time claiming "gourmet" coffee is much different. 

Bonus: This DD is in Sam's Town casino. You can take your coffee to the atrium (not in DD or near slot machines) and enjoy it in the "wooded" atmosphere...it's like you're outside with the piped in animal sounds...COOL. 

So...save your money and try it.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Came here for dinner with my wife and daughter and was pretty pleased with everything, especially given that I am pretty fussy when it comes to Italian food. The service was more than accommodating and the interior was a real surprise, definitely feeling a little more upscale than most Italian restaurants in strip malls. The bar set up was pretty cool too and good to grab something to eat and watch a game and have a drink. We ordered the calzone, they have family size portions and after splitting this between my wife and myself, we still had a little to take home! It was actually one of the best calzones I have had in a while, had plenty of ingredients and the dough was tasty. My wife's family had owned a pizza restaurant for years and she loved it! Given the food, service, ambience and price, we will definitely be back.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I ate there 2 times. I recommend sea food soup, spicy salty shrimp, Singapore rice noodle. The location is not that good. It's in Sun Prairie, a suburb area from Madison, WI. I believe if the location is in downtown Madison, it would be one of the top Chinese restaurant in Madison.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>If you come for lunch or an early dinner, the pricing is good. Seven pounds ninety five for a two course lunch. I had the Thom Yum noodle soup. Spicy and tangy. 
The thai conversation coming from the kitchen was a nice atmospheric touch.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Los Compadres rocks.  It's nice to have a good mercado on this side of town.

The carniceria (meat market) is well-stocked and has a wide variety.  Carnitas, carne asada, pork ribs...they're all here!

I like the fresh sweet bread.  And, I especially like the tamales.  Sometimes you just have to have a tamale.  Especially around the holidays.  It's a Latin thing.

Enjoy!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>One of the best things ever is to see talented people develop a new concept, plan it with care, and execute it masterfully.  When the buzz began months ago about Chef Beckett and partners, Katie and Scott Stephens, wanting to bring a southern flair to the area, Peg and I were all in.  That the new place was going to be at the site of a landmark (Beef Eaters Restaurant) with its own history of fine food was a nice touch. This is not Beckett's Table West...the concept is totally different. The fried green tomatoes and dirty rice croquettes were spot on.  The tomato tart and the house smoked trout appetizers were addictive, inventive and wonderfully balanced. A grilled watermelon salad was a light refreshing bite. As you would expect, all things pork were terrific, and Rail's cider brined pork loin was amazing. Ditto the crispy duck leg confit. The BLT salad was very tasty but the other apps were better yet. Making the call to try their gumbo (ya ya style) and BBQ shrimp was mandatory, and they were full of flavor, not obnoxiously hot like some "Cajun style" dishes out there have become. I strongly recommend wearing something that will handle butter and sauce well from the shrimp. Limitless napkins are provided...  Staples like mac and cheese, collards, and brioche with apple butter (think Parker House rolls) were very good. Beignets were authentic and pillowy. Even with it being opening night and week, the service (Jerod (hopefully not misspelled too badly) and Sarah were attentive and very helpful. Front of the house was welcoming. With concepts and execution like this, I frankly don't care "what the fox say!"</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The family and I were looking to grab some lunch at Chipotle, but we got lost and came to Kokopelli instead. It's similar to Chipotle - made to order burritos and other typical Mexican food - but Chipotle it is not.

To tell you the truth, I wasn't too hungry to begin with so I ordered a chicken quesadilla and I got exactly that - a tortilla with cheese and chicken. Nothing else. Even though it was what I ordered and contained all ingredients necessary to live up to its description, I just felt like the whole thing was "meh". I got some pico de gallo on the side which helped a bit, but I was only given a little to-go cup full (there is no salsa bar) and given my salsa usage, it only lasted a couple bites.

The burritos ordered by the rest of my family didn't seem all that interesting either. I didn't get to taste anything but, from first glance, the bean to burrito filling ratio was wrong (too much beans, not enough meat - what can i say, I'm picky about my burritos!) and the burritos seemed as "meh" as my quesadilla was. 

I wish we had gone to Chipotle.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place is great and I'm so glad I found it so soon!! The employees are so friendly and happy and willing to help and serve you. I am gluten-free, so when I asked for the gf crust, the lady actually asked if I wanted her to change her gloves for my allergy...that type of competence and willingness is RARE. 

It's only 7.99 for a make your own 11 inch pizza, which if you only get one topping is ok, but it's for unlimited toppings. So in theory you could get like all the veggies, all the seasonings, all the specialty meats and everything for only 8$...which is awesome.

The flavors are great and it's a little more unique than other places (they have cool flavors and jerk seasonings and tangy seasonings, etc)

I will definitely be returning and can't wait to return. 

It's really rare to find places that actually offer and honor and want to serve gluten free customers.


THANK YOU!!

Give it a try and get lots of toppings so you get more for your money :). 

Update: went back the next day- still great!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Late night Madison is tough when you are hungry.  I saw that this dive bar was packed the night before so we stopped in on a Sunday evening.  The few patrons in the bar were playing metal at full volume.  We all had the Packer Burger which was a big MEH.  Not the worst place I have ever been but I have been to some dumps.  I would not seek the Packer Inn out in the future.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I can't keep my mind off of pizza today for some reason, and thinking about Johnny Mac's isn't helping any.  This pizzeria's been around in Henderson for literally as long as I can remember, and it's devotees are strong in both number and ferocity.

Now, the pizza here is good, don't get me wrong.  It's an authentic, made-just-for-you, pie of yuminess.  However, the pizza isn't what gets people about this place, it's the pizza's accompaniment:  the wings.  Johnny Mac hails from Buffalo and brought his special secret recipe with him when he migrated here.  Many people claim these wings are the best in the valley and I would have to agree with them.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This nice little West End branch of Pizza Express doesn't look like much from the outside; it gives the impression that's it's just another branch of this popular chain. Once you're inside and led through to the back of the restaurant, it opens out into a conservatory area that's perfect for enjoying a pizza on a light summer's evening. I am always able to get a table here at short notice, even if it means popping over to Mathers for half an hour for an aperitif. The staff are friendly and on my last visit were surprisingly tolerant of me and three drunken friends, who were the last diners to leave the restaurant by a long shot. Even my hard to please boyfriend likes this place and that is praise indeed.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Fantastic food, great atmosphere and excellent service! There is an amazing outdoor patio overlooking lush tropical landscaping and the resorts signature tropical pool. Loved the sliding glass doors that brought the outside in. Perfect place to grab a good bite and transport yourself to the tropics. It's like being on vacation. 

The bartenders are fantastic with 24 beers on tap and the food was great. Love the island ribs and the best hamburgers in the city!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This was our first time experiencing Korean BBQ. The waitress did ask if we had been before to which we responded no. Regardless she did not explain how it worked. The food was tasty. It was a nice place for a slow meal with lovely conversation but I spent my meal not entirely sure I was "doing it right". I'm okay at admitting I was a novice. I wish the staff had explained a little more what to do - though this may be obvious for someone who has been for Korean BBQ before.
We really enjoyed the new and pineapple. The salmon was also very nice.

There is a toddler/pre-schooler price but I was very glad we didn't have our daughter with us given the way you prepare the food and how wiggly she is. Kids around 7/8 seemed to be with their families having a great time though. 

I had to look online as to how to eat to find out about making little sandwiches with the lettuce. 

I think it is priced geared to the experience rather than the food itself.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I thought the Pizza Express restaurant in Glasgow was the worlds most boring place to eat but alas the one in Edinburgh is boredom of equal measure. So, Pizza Express pizzas are good but do they really deserve to have a restaurant? I don't know what came first, the chicken or the egg? The Pizza Express restaurant or the Pizza Express pizzas in supermarkets? I'm guessing the restaurant came first but either way buying one of these bad boys in ASDA and slobbing out on the couch is a much better way to eat them.

Everything about this place is dull, the decor, the lighting and the fact that everything is made to look as fancy as possible. Do yourself a favour and just buy one of the pizzas at your local supermarket, stick it in the oven and eat it at home.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>According to a quick web search, I've learned that a scullery is a secondary room used for several things. It can be used for washing and cleaning, or even as an overflow kitchen. Apart from it's traditional use, I never saw bar in a description of scullery. Perhaps that's why we saw a couple try to bring their baby in? I don't know, but Scullery is definitely a bar and babies definitely aren't allowed. If you do plan to come here, don't bring your kids or you'll be kicked out and upset screaming that you'll "never return" as you walk out. Yes, that actually happened.

For those with common sense, here's how to find Scullery. They are inside The Ogden and located on the far east side of the building, right on the corner of 6th and Ogden. When you walk in, you'll see a small bar with limited seating to your right and some small tables with additional seating to your left. Walk down the hallway and you'll find three 6-seat private booths with bathrooms oddly placed right next to the them. Then hidden way in the back is a 100 seat jazz theater. I can only assume the theater is where they plan to focus all their business with the bar and additional seating in the front used as a non-traditional scullery. See what I did there?

During our visit, we spent the majority of our time in a private booth, which in my opinion are extremely uncomfortable for many reasons. The seats themselves suck and unless everyone in your party is 5' tall or less, expect to be bumping knees and elbows all night. There's also no barriers of any sort in the booth area or anywhere else. So, as you're watching everyone come in and out of the bathroom right next to your table the whole time, you also get to hear the echoes of noises from every other section of the place. If you wanted to hang out in the bar area, forget that. Once there's about 15-20 people in there, you won't even be able to move. So, even though we spent no time hanging out in the jazz room, I'd blindly recommend you just go straight there.

Now, on to Scullery's two sided menu. The first is their "Fine Intoxicants" which feature 5 specialty cocktails, a fairly extensive wine list and 10 beers. Our somewhat waiter/bartender categorized the cocktails as digestif. I got to sample quite a few of the drinks from what everyone in our group ordered and I wasn't a fan of any but one, the Ogden Anthem. It's slightly cola like and even though I don't drink soda, I thought it was decent and it's definitely easy to drink. I ordered an Old Fashioned for myself which I didn't like at all. It felt like they made the drink and then filled the rest of the glass up with tap water. Lore got the Downtown Afternoon which tasted like straight up pineapple juice. With the majority of their cocktails running $10+, I just wasn't feeling the drinks at all.

The other side of the menu is what the call the "Gourmet Pantry". Unfortunately, they don't have everything available just yet so they were only offering up sample boards. They had three to choose from, a small board for $17, a medium for $30 and a large for $50. Another employee came out to describe the boards and told us that the small is only designed for 1-2 people and we'd probably have a hard time splitting the large between the 6 of us. It was a bit disappointing as we all wanted to check out what they had but couldn't justify paying those prices. 

Apart from that, I didn't understand the service here. When we first arrived, it was dead and our bartender/waiter was pretty attentive and helpful. After we got our drinks, we pretty much never saw him again and just kept having random employees come "check" on us. There was no organization and I know they're new, but it seemed like the few people we dealt with were way too uninformed on what they were serving. We did have the food/beverage manager Jeremy come introduce himself which was nice but the service lacks. They even messed up our check.

All in all, I just didn't dig this place. I wouldn't say I was in a rush to leave but I had no desire to stay and I definitely won't be coming back. Sorry Scullery, but you just didn't impress on any level for me.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>i am one of the biggest advocators or Starbucks....ok I know to some coffee-lovers that's hen-us, but I love the chilled atmosphere and the friendly staff and the good products. However this branch isn't one I would recommend. It's small, the staff are a bit nippy, and the tables are never clean. Plus it's always really busy.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Love love love Nixon's.  I'm a big fan of the political commentary, quotes and humor all around the place.  But the rest of it is great too.  Wonderful dark wood tables and booths.  I almost hadn't realized there was an upstairs the first few times I went - even though it's a small place.  Has the feeling of a neighborhood pub in many ways.

Service has always been great too.  One bartender even let me surf through one of her drink encyclopedia's to see if I could find something to inspire me.  Only problem now is that I totally loved the drink and no one else seems to know what it is by the name in the book.  (Greenie Meanie - Anyone?  Anyone???)  

Food is more yummy that I'd anticipated too.  I've tried several things (Wanted to get names but I have no memory and they have no menu online) and they were all quite good.  

Special note - they are closed on Sundays.  I've been there several times when I wanted to go after catching a Sunday movie and I've wondered why they looked closed.  Now I know.  Other than that they are open 11am-2am M-F and 4pm-2am on Saturday.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I was so very skeptical. Magic Wok took over the worn and drab Wong's Garden. Wong's Garden once was a great place to eat.  For the last few years, the food was awful. I was so excited to read that the business had been sold and the restaurant would serve Chinese food. The restaurant seemed brighter and cleaner. Maybe it was a fresh coat of paint but whatever they did, it sure helped.

Good Chinese food is a very personal matter and can span a variety of presentations. I love the old school Chinese, moo-shu, mapo, kung pao, if the food is cooked well. Dishes should have loads of veggies that still have some crunch and sauce with plenty of flavor. I also love the more authentic Chinese food that you find at Ichiban on Park St.  Magic Wok was the former; egg rolls, won-ton soup, lo mein and plenty more.

I visited Magic Wok with two of my neighbors. One is amazingly picky. We all put the owner through her paces, asking a million questions and making special requests. Thank goodness it wasn't busy. She was patient, informative and friendly. Her husband was in the back doing the cooking and he did a damn good job

I had the orange tofu. The tofu was lightly fried, crispy on the outside soft in the center. It came with broccoli (still crunchy) and a lovely orange sauce.  It was really good. We also ordered the Stir Fried Pan Fried Egg Noodles with Chicken. The noodles were super crispy topped with chicken and loads of veggies and a full-flavored brown sauce. Over time those crispy noodles soaked up that yummy sauce. We wished the dish came with a little more sauce. Finally, we also ate the Kung Pao Chicken. The chicken was plentiful as were the veggies. The peanuts added some crunch and salt to this spicy dish. It too was a hit.

I love my neighborhood, replete with good food. I am a fan of Ha Long Bay and Wah-Kee but I am happy to have a good Chinese restaurant right within my reach. I wish them the best and encourage them to keep up the good work. I shall return.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Walking distance to Chase Field makes this a popular destination. 

The Mexican food is very good, the drinks are cheap, they have a huge outdoor patio, a large bar area, and you can wobble over to the ballgame when you're finished.

If you get here early enough you can park in their own private lot for free.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Gavin's got this one right, the cheese is that cheap stuff that all cafes usually use for toasties. Melted, it's fine, un-melted you'd be safer chewing on a sock.

One detail that usually wouldn't be a problem in any other take away, but cheese holds everything together in a good baked potato. A good cheese might have made up for dodgy haggis Gavin had.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>In my quest to try all the restaurants on 7th Street near my house, I decided to check out Pizza Heaven. Pizza Heaven is another one of those hole-in-the-wall eateries that you hear about via word-of-mouth. Oh sure, I can sit here and spout out multi-hyphenated phrases all day, but in the end, Pizza Heaven is a great little place to get a slice or two.

You can do just that. Their menu offers pizza by the slice. Or if you're in a mood to share, you can order a whole conventional pie. Each slice is individually baked, so you should allay those fears of eating something that's been sitting under a heat lamp for who-knows-how-long. They come out of the oven piping hot and delicious. The ongoing daily special is Two Cheese Slices and a fountain drink for $4.00. Toppings are 50 cents extra, per slice, which is still not a bad deal if you want to add pepperoni and still not break the bank.

I first heard about Pizza Heaven when some of my coworkers, during their several-times-a-week (I'm trying to stop with the hyphenates, honestly) ritual of ordering take out, started to pass a menu around. Now, I may not be accustomed to traditional Italian calzones, but something that caught me off guard was the fact that the calzone came with ricotta cheese as opposed to mozzarella. On recent visits, I've specified mozzarella be used rather than their default of ricotta. Other items ordered by my colleagues included Angel Bread Sticks, Meatball Parmigiana Stuffed Sandwich and the Insalata Caprese. There wasn't one item that they delivered that didn't look good. The menu also offers a whole wheat crust option and you can order your pizza with soy cheese if you feel the need. Other items on the menu I have yet to try include various pasta dishes, chicken wings (your choice of Mild, Medium, Hot or the painful-sounding "Suicide" variety) and desserts which include Cheesecake and Tiramisu.

I had actually eaten Pizza Heaven's dishes several times before actually setting foot in the restaurant thanks to their quick delivery service to my place of business. When I ultimately made it there in the flesh, the first thing I noticed was how clean it was inside. The menu touts that Channel 3 News gave them the distinction of  "Cleanest Kitchen in the Valley". I would have to agree that if the kitchen looks anything like the rest of the interior, then they keep things in excellent and sanitary condition. The restaurant has also been awarded New Times "Best of Phoenix" award and although I haven't tried too many other local pizza places, I would have to agree that the award was well-deserved.

For those of you who don't want to pull yourself away from the comfort of your couch and your precious XBox, you can have your food delivered for a minimum of a $15 order. Whether or not the driver will be gracious enough to feed it to you so you won't have to pause your gameplay is entirely at his or her discretion, and I'm sure will require a larger tip.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>In a town that is constantly trying to reinvent itself, it's nice that there are still some things you can count on,  like great food and friendly service at Triple Play American Grill.  After the namesake restaurant closed it's doors last December,  several of us long time locals were left with a hankering for some of the favorites we loved for so long.   At the new TPAG the atmosphere is relaxed and everyone is super friendly, but most importantly, our favorite dishes are back!  The tender and delicious cheesesteaks, hearty burgers, stacked sandwiches and even fresh salads for those watching their figures.  Classic American, done right.  

We are so glad Jim has found a new home and can't wait to go back!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Nothing special, but a little better than the "average Chinese buffet."  I didn't get any water or drinks when I arrived, but that's not too big of a deal to me.  Overall the experience met my expectations and I would return in the future.

Pros: They have all-you-can pho, clean, plates cleared quickly, attentive/friendly staff,

Cons: Slow to replenish food, some food looked like they sat out way to long, charged for soda refills</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Hong Kong station brings Hong Kong to Madison! 

This place opened on February 28th, and I popped in on its first business day for a late lunch. There were owner's friends and kids running around in the restaurant. We received a big welcome as we were the very first patrons of their business. 

From the outside, it still says Vientiane Palace, and you have to look close to notice that Hong Kong Station is open. They need to fix that as soon as possible. The inside decor is very interesting, full of posters of beer brands, Budweiser, Leinie's, Miller Lite, Corona, not your typical setting for a Chinese restaurant. It is still slightly a hole in the wall kind of place, but you could see the owner made effort to make the dining environment more enjoyable. 

A big section of their menu is "cart noodles"--the type of noodles sold from street carts in Hong Kong, therefore the name. This is "make your own noodle bowl" fun time. You'll need to choose 1) a soup base (clear soup, beef, or "pungent and spicy") 2) your favorite noodle out of 9 choices 3) toppings: from vegetables, meat, to more exotic items like pig blood, pig skin, pig intestine, and chicken claws. 1 &amp; 2 costs $4, and each topping is $1. I consider this price very good deal. 

The rest of lunch menu (11a-5p) offer some very authentic HK style appetizers, rices, noodles, and congee. You won't be wrong ordering from this section. In the dinner menu section (offer full day), there are some bigger Cantonese entree dishes. 

A BIG plus for Hong Kong station is that they offer real Siu mei/Shaola (See wikipedia if you don't know about this). You'll see roasted chickens, ducks, and pork hung in front of their kitchen. It might be a bit confusing to make Siu mei orders. You can choose one kind of meat to go with a plate of rice, or simply ask the restaurant to slice certain amount for you. 

In our lunch, we tried beef cart noodle ($6), wonton noodle ($6.75), and squid balls in curry sauce ($1.75). Everything was very delicious. I felt like I were in Hong Kong. I have been a fan to wontons at Wah Kee noodle, but I think what I got at Hong Kong Station was even better. 

The service was fast and friendly. They take credit card. The staff do not speak the best English, so make sure you communicate patiently. 

Don't expect some fancy food from this modest place. It offers affordable, tasty, and authentic HK food. 

If you are not familiar with Hong Kong style eateries, it might take some time for you to navigate the menu and take bold food adventures. But trust me, this place should not let you down. 

P.S. compare with other Chinese places nearby, HKS just makes much better food with lower prices than Nam's noodle. And just don't go to Ichiban or Oriental House for rice and noodle. These two places are good for regular entrees, noodles definitely belong to HKS.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I was surprised that this location has changed hands yet again. The "new owners" told my wife (in Chinese because she is Chinese) that they didn't know where the old owners went??? Right. Anyway, the food is not really bad, but it is much more traditional Chinese food instead of the Americanized version most of us are accustomed to. (White Fungus Tofu Soup, Yu Fu, Bitter Melon, etc.) The portions are definitely smaller and the prices are considerably higher. The menu I was given, I hope, is just a transitional menu and the real ones are at the printers as we speak. I say this because there are no appetizers like egg rolls, won ton soup, etc at all on the menu I saw. Also there are no combination plates or lunch specials that I could see. The old restaurant had a better selection, lower prices and bigger portions yet still could not make it. I feel certain these guys won't be around for very long either. I doubt we will return.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The best sandwich I've had in my life was one I had at the Teeter House ... the Prosciutto, Salami and Imported Provolone sandwhich.  I was so addicted to it one summer, I walked over there maybe 3-4 times a week to order it.  It was bizzare rolling up in a RVCA tee and a pair of cargos and Reefs while the other partrons were having some kind of Royal Family flashback in their feathery headpieces and pinkys skyward.

But whatever.  I ALWAYS sat outside under their very large oak(?) trees that shade most of their front area.  This was great for some serious people watching ... mostly tourist wondering why Bianco is closed at noon, but attempting the door anyway.  They would eventually mosey over to Teeter ... good for them!

Anyhow, back to this sandwhich.  Its unbeleivable and pretty large with a side of rosemary potato salad and some fruit.  Teeter house also serves beer and wine, which was always nice.  They have a pretty good selection too.

My only complaint is that they open too late (for morning coffee -- although once i guess i looked thoroughly disappointed that they weren't open yet early on a Sunday while they were setting up and gave me a free coffee-to-go anyway!) and they close way too early.  If they serve booze, they should mos def stay open til midnight or so, especially with a haunted house for effect.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>I love this place! Their sauces are ridiculously good, the seafood seems extremely fresh. I only have two things I would say:
1) their canolis aren't as good as other Italian restaurants; the filling almost seems chalky
2) their kids' menu has a good selection, but the red/marinara sauce they use for the kids' dishes seems considerably lower quality than that used in other dishes.
Otherwise, I HIGHLY recommend this place.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>boy we are so happy to finally have a little taste of southern california in our backyard. yeah we have fatburger &amp; in &amp; out too but bob's big boy folded up last year and that was our favorite. tommy's serves chili on everything so if you like chili head to tommy's. the burgers are huge &amp; they load on the chili, the shakes are awesome, the fries are nice &amp; crispy and loaded with chili &amp; cheese. i wish they gave you an alka-seltzer with your meal though because you are gonna need it. the place looks great-alot like in &amp; out, the service is very fast &amp; friendly and the food is pretty darn good for a fast food joint. we posted this place last week as soon as we found it has opened and after a long day at the car show we had to make a pit stop for a long awaited bite of socal history!! we definitely recommend tommy's for a good old-fashioned chili burger!!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Stopped in on their opening day where they had a limited menu and brisket was still to be had at 1 pm. I had the brisket, a pork rib and the only side available, Jalapeno cheese grits. The brisket was superb and melted in my mouth and the pork rib was just what I wanted, a well seasoned and perfectly moist and cooked rib. I liked everything I tried but while the grits tasted great, they were mushy being the reason for only 4 stars. It was opening day and I changed, giving them 5 stars on the brisket and ribs plus their service is superb, I can't hold the grits against them as the tasted great but slightly off on texture this day. I have tried their grits at the Farmers market and know it was just an off day with their quiet grand opening.  I love this place and know they will get all 5 stars from me on my future visits but I had to be honest on opening night. I highly recommend Little Miss Bbq and can't wait to try their other sides as well as the beef short ribs. Most that follow me on Yelp know I tell the truth and don't sugar coat my reviews, This place is legit and screams great Texas BBQ. Let me know your thoughts on your visit.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Ok, I'm not gonna lie.  I feel a bit silly reviewing a McDonalds, but you have to give credit where it's due.  The five stars goes to the morning crew.  There have been many mornings where i have been hungry on the way to work, so i succumb to the temptation of the golden arches.
I used to be intimidated if there are four or five cars in line.  Not at this place.  And not only are they SUPER fast, it's ALWAYS fresh and delicious.  I'll often pick up egg and cheese mcmuffins for some of my coworkers and we all agree.  They must have magic elves in the kitchen because these are the best mcmuffins e.v.e.r.  
I also think they must have some sort of mind control device that causes your time to speed up while their time slows down, because on more than one occasion, I've barely had to stop my car because there they are, window open, beverage and bag in hand, smile and "have a nice day" on their lips.  
The pm crew leaves a bit to to be desired, but the morning crew has me at hello.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Decent Gryros, falafel, and miscellaneous Chicago favorites are served up here in this narrow location in a strip mall on the NW corner of 59th Ave. and Beardsley/101.  Prices are a little high for what you get, and the new picture menu is a little obnoxious to me because it takes so long to find what I want.  I guess the newb customers don't know what the menu items are by name, so they had to create this huge pictoral menu as if their customer base is illiterate.

Food can take a long time even when they're not busy.  There's often no seating whatsoever.  If you have extra time on your hands and don't mind the wait, then give them a try.  Chicken gyro is reportedly good (many family members) but I prefer the falafel.  Hummus is just ok.  Fries are alright.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Wendy's has improved their quality of late and this location has made it onto our short list of "fail-safe" weekend or late night food options. 

Speed: Typically faster than most Wendy's locations, with 2 out of 10 times I have to pull forward to wait for my food. 
Attention to detail: Beware, this location has an issue with drink cup lids coming off because they didn't press them on and make sure they're on. 
Service: Why yes, I want to order fries and apple slices with the kids meal. This location asks more than the rest if I'm sure. Yes I'm sure, I asked for it, I have a debit card in hand, do you not want to take my money? Repeat after me: french fries and a side of apple slices. See, that wasn't so hard now was it? 
Cleanliness: When you look in the drive through window the place doesn't look like a shrine to lard like some places do. (Including the Wendy's at Marks and Sunset which just looks icky).

I usually use the drive through, the inside seating area is typically clean but it's also dated and in serious need of a refresh. 

Overall 3 Stars: Since we don't have Chick-Fil-A here, if you like a spicy chicken sandwich you make do with what you have.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Awesome!  Authentic East Coast down to the apple cider and whoopie pies!

Open space just off Venetian Grand Canal food court, just walk up and order.   Casual, easy, welcoming. 

I have been told the lobster roll options are more expansive than the options at Planet Hollywood location.  We had been told what were the personal favorites of the person behind the counter: the Original Maine Lobster Roll and the Cajun Lobster Roll.  We split these rolls and they did not disappoint.  FRESH, quality lobster served on a toasted bread like bun.  The roll comes in a Large for $17 or an XL for $23.  The Cajun was not incredibly spicy, but enough to make it interesting. 

I would recommend for a casual specific food option for great quality lobster rolls while on Las Vegas Blvd.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The full open starts 1/27/14! We popped in today to try it out while they are still working out the kinks! I have to say service was fabulous! We got Misti who was extremely friendly! There was 3 in my party, 2 loved their meal... I am gluten free... so I am fairly limited in what I can eat there... I got the naked wings (no breading) I can't complain because well... what fun is a naked wing!?! Stupid me, next time I will try something else! I guess I figured if they offered it must be good... live &amp; learn :o) I have to mention I LOVE their cups! Nice and big, ok... yea, I'm that weird :o) Glad to see another option in the area and more business in Surprise!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Located on the east side of 7th St. just south of Thomas.  Another homey little cottage with hardwood floors.  Consistently good food at moderate prices keeps this place busy the only days of the week they're open for dinner, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  They have a strict reservations policy now, due to increased popularity in a small space.  They feature things like Lasagna, Pork chops, Stew - comfort food with a kick, and they do it well.  Close to downtown, makes it a great spot to be before an evenings event.  If you notify your wait staff right off, they do a good job of getting you on your way on time.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>THIS is a Crowne Plaza? I must disagree. So I'm not on the club floor, but since when is a fourth-floor King Suite more comparable to Section 8 housing than a reputable hotel chain? I feel like I have gone back in time, to my baby-boomer parent's 1980's bungalow (not on the beach people - think small, dark, smelly and well, 80s). 

Towels? Yuck. Wallpaper? Significantly peeling off the walls. Windowsill? Covered in bugs ON THE INSIDE. Curtains? Burned with cigarettes. Furniture? Sagging and questionable. I could go on, but I'm sure you get the point. 

We checked in around midnight after driving to Madison from Chicago in a horrible snowstorm. I was in NO mood for the clueless night auditor who argued with us about everything and then could not seem to locate one luggage cart or extra pillow. Give me a break. 

I think everything here looks dirty, low-brow and in need of an upgrade. Considering I have to stay two more nights I'm going to go ahead and suck it up, but for those of you who aren't here yet, I would go ahead and make a beeline for the other direction.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>the tiki bar is fun! (open in the summer every night from 4p-10p with the exclusion of possible friday and saturday night weddings that rent it out privately)

but the fish fry on friday nights is definitely worth skipping. cold, bland food for too much money. full of elderly people, which usually means it's just bland and cheap, but it was $24 for my husband and i to have the buffet (which is the only option on fridays, don't know about other days). i love fish frys and this one was highly disappointing.

BUT i'm still giving this place 4 stars because the back yard and tiki bar are pretty stellar and they have a sunday brunch that i'd still like to try out. i wouldn't go there for dinner again though, but if you want to drink a beer and sit by the lake (assuming that you don't already live on a lake), this is the place to go! friendly staff and gorgeous views of the capitol, especially at night.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The Theatre Royal is of course affiliated with its neighbour, The Playhouse. I don't know if it is in business terms, but certainly the theme of this bar is to please the theatre goers as they step in for pre theatre drinks and eats.

Because of its proximity to the Playhouse, it maintains a high standard of service and quality. The walls are freshly painted a rich red, there are theatre posters from years ago framed in each corner of the space, and the large horsehoe bar serves up a number of nice beers and spirits.

They serve up the usual pub fayre for lunch, and it's not too expensive considering its central location. The bar staff are friendly and although it can get busy when a show is about to start, if you aim to get here a couple of hours early you could set yourself up for the night with a relaxed bottle of wine and a wee chat. They have outdoor seating which is enjoyed by locals, tourists and theatre goers during the sunny afternoons.

I like this bar. I would drink in it even if I wasn't going to the theatre, and make it my local if I stayed nearby. The exterior decor with the bugle players is interesting, making it stand out as one of the older and classier bars in the area. But what I like most of all about this place is that they keep their toilets clean and tidy. What's more, they pipe music through them. At long last I've found somewhere which plays elevator music in the bathroom. There's nothing worse than doing a wee and awkwardly knowing that your wee, along with those in the neighbouring cubicles, are amplified. Makes washing your hands beside your previously anonymous pee partner needlessly embarrassing. 

So even though they were playing Joe McElderry of X Factor fame when I visited, I would gladly take that over the icy silence that usually falls on bathrooms. A round of applause for Theatre Royal!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>A good jukebox, a nice section of pool tables and plenty of seating make this one of my favorite old school Phoenix bars. 

Years ago, they had a reputation for being "soft" on ID's, so I was a regular when I was home from school my freshman year in college. Since then, apparently there has been some sort of crackdown but the main things that make it a good spot to kick back with a few pitchers and friends remain unchanged. 

You'll find that around thanksgiving and Christmas the crowds are overwhelming, as it has become the unofficial reunion bar for Phoenix natives that have since migrated to other parts of the country and world. The rest of the year it is easy to find seats at the bar or one of the tables, and the laid back divey atmosphere makes it easy to have a good time.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We just stumbled into this place on a trip to Phoenix last weekend.  Maybe it's a matter of taste in view of the other review on this page,  but we thought this place serves GREAT Chinese, with excellent attentive service and excellent prices, (although I'm used to LA prices and Phoenix is generally more economical across the board.)  We opted for  the fixed menu dinner, which we usually do not do, and the selections were very good.  The moo-shu pork was my favorite, although the rest of the dishes were also outstanding. There is a wonderful garlic chicken dish.  They put a little hibachi on the table so we could cook our own little skewers of beef.  We liked the very hearty soup. I did not notice any of the downside aspects noted in the other review.  The outside is not much to look at, just a rather plain free-standing building, but the interior decor is right out of the 50's, like the old style Cantonese places back then.  They play quiet Chinese music in the background, a nice touch that enhances the experience.  Plenty of parking and a bar if you like that sort of thing.  Thanks for a great evening, China Village !

UDATE:  Dropped in again a few months later- just to see if the quality stayed up- and it was as good as before.  They even recognized us from months earlier.  We had the fixed menu dinner for six and they were very cooperative in making some changes based on our tastes.  Thanks again..  China Village.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Walking into this place looks nice and well kept. I liked the setup they have. I'm giving this place five star rating not for how nice and casual it is but for the food. I haven't tried everything on the menu yet, but I will that's my plan in the near future. I have had at least five items from the menu so far and I got hooked.  It all tasted to what I expected it to and I'm glad for that because there isn't a lot of kosher restaurants out here, so it's nice to know I can get kosher food in a restaurant and enjoy it. The menu selections are awesome a lot to choose from, so there's something for everybody that loves to eat from pastas to pizzas and so on. By the way this place is dairy only. Give them a try you will enjoy it.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>We enjoyed dinner tonight at the Native New Yorker very much! The restaurant just opened this week so there are some kinks in the service and the kitchen that need to be worked out but boy howdy the food was pretty darn good! It was served at the right temps, our drinks were kept fairly full, and the wait staff was falling all over each other to help. 

Because there was quite a crowd tonight, service was a bit slow. It took quite a while for our appetizers to come out and when we would ask our server to bring something to us, he would disappear...and only reappear when he had another reason to come back to our table or the others in his station. I realized that what he was trying to do was be efficient in his trips, but he did have a trainee with him who he could have delegated these things to so that we wouldn't be sitting and waiting for extra dressing or ketchup or silverware. It's a kink to be worked out tho.

Another issue I noticed was that the kitchen didn't make the dishes to specs. For example, on the menu the kids sliders indicated there would be cheese and pickles on the sliders. There were no pickles. My MILs salad was to include croutons and there were no croutons (and not NEARLY enough dressing either but that's another issue) That having been said...for kids sliders these were AWESOME! They aren't slider size tho--rather they are more like McDonalds cheeseburger size! They are pretty big for sliders. They are served on a pretzel bun too! I KNOW--fancy schmancy for kids sliders. But again...if you say on the menu that it comes with pickles..make sure you serve to specs. 

I had the skinny chicken lettuce wraps which were excellent. I thought it was interesting to serve on romaine versus iceberg lettuce but it worked itself out. My husband had fish and chips and really enjoyed. I LOVED how the coleslaw was made per order versus just made that day and left to sit and wilt. My son had a burger as well that was really great and my FIL had a calzone which he loved.

I will DEFINITELY be back to Native New Yorker. I think they did a very good job considering this is first week opening. I think (hope) it will only get better and not disappoint! They will be a nice addition to the middle of Surprise. :)</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>One of the rare times I indulge in restaurant food is for breakfast, and I wanted to try Taco Bell's new breakfast menu. I pulled into the drive-thru at 7:20 a.m., and all the inside and outside lights were on, including the drive-thru menu's, but the only person working was the guy power-washing the sidewalks--nobody home even though there were signs everywhere advertising that the place was now open for breakfast! I headed to my office dejectedly and checked the website to find out this location doesn't open until 9 a.m. If you're going to serve a breakfast menu, please keep breakfast hours that suit the average commuting breakfast eater, especially when you're competing with a dozen other fast food joints in a half-mile radius who are all also serving breakfast but open at 6 if they're not already open 24 hours. I have had other stuff from here since I've worked and lived nearby for the past 10 years, and it's otherwise decent service and passable fast food, but with so many other affordable and decent Mexican joints around with drive-thru windows, this isn't worth it for lunch or dinner, either, unless you're in a real time crunch.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>5-stars for Papa John's? Am I crazy?

Yes. Probably.

But it really is worth of the rating. Why?

- So easy to order online; brilliantly intuitive and logical
- The inside of the store is spotless - I've never seen it in disarray
- Staff is friendly and efficient
- Consistent quality; there's no hoping the pizza is as good as a previous time - it just is
- Never greasy
- Quite possibly the best "well done thin crust" pizza I've ever had in the Madison area. It holds-up without flopping over, even when piping hot, and it's always perfectly cooked, without being burned or overly charred. 

I'm not a fan of their commercials or PJ's personal philosophies. That said, I have yet to find a better thin crust in Madison. I'll keep looking, though.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Ah, Miracle Mile! I will always love you.

I grew up in Phoenix during the 70s and 80s, offspring of parents who had grown up on the East Coast and knew what a real deli was supposed to taste like and smell like, and at that point in Phoenix history MM was the only game in town for that kind of experience. Probably still is. 

Anyway, we ate at the old Park Central location hundreds (okay, maybe just dozens and dozens) of times, sampling everything on the menu -- the pastrami is still my favorite, though. I can even remember when they expanded and built out that back patio with the koi pond, which quickly became my favorite place to sit when I went there with my mom. The Chris-Town location was okay, too, but it didn't have the koi pond so it wasn't as interesting to me.

And the guys who worked behind the counter, what a bunch of old pros. If you went there during lunch rush, you had better know what you wanted when you reached the counter (and since you'd probably been staring at the menu for five minutes you had no excuse not to) or you'd get sent to the back of the line!

I was sad to hear that Park Central location was gone, a little piece of my childhood being closed off. But this location at the Colonnade, it's not bad and the pastrami is every bit as delicious as I remember from years past. I can't wait until the next time I'm in Phoenix to visit my mom so we can go there again!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>This place is A-ok in my book!! Been there once and I plan on returning. A co-worker and I ventured in this place - not having any expectations and we were surprised how decent it was. Definately what you call a dive bar... 
Bartender that night was one of those grumpy old looking guys who turn out to be pretty damn funny. Great guy who definately knows his sports. Place gots the whole digital jukebox thing going, a couple of pool tables, golf game, a few tv's  and shuffleboard. Cheap alcohol with plenty of beers on tap... 
A great place to drink a cold one after a long night at work</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Stopped into this smaller Jack in the Box today for a bite, armed with a coupon for 2 free tacos.  Added in a Chicken Sandwich ($1) &amp; some Frank's Red Hot from the secret menu (free) &amp; it really perked up both the tacos &amp; the sandwich.

I was all set with a fine light lunch for ONE DOLLAR!!  The bathroom, dining room (with BOOTHS!  Yay booths!) &amp; service were fine too, so they earned 4 Stars!     :-))</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The staff are still very green and refer back to the manager for questions, but they are up and running as of this week, I believe, and they are totally hopping!

Maybe 4 or 5 tables outside and plenty of bright seating indoors.  Clean (open less than a week, so no shocker there), and their simply delicious and fresh food!

The salad dressing is their signature and available on all the tables. It's definitely not a light dressing though, so if you want something lighter, ask for the lemon vinaigrette on the side instead.

Unknown to the reservations department at Caesars' and inciting an "I don't believe it is open yet" when I contacted The Linq concierge suffice it to say that the "Asian Nightmarket"-inspired F.A.M.E. quietly opened to the public on Friday and having stopped in to see the space then I returned the next day just after the doors opened at 11am to give it a taste, my seventy-minute visit curated by the expansive venue's two owners while a young, energetic staff buzzed around explaining the concept to curious customers. Not only new but decidedly nontraditional in its format with several stations encompassing stir-fry, soups, dim-sum, BBQ, Thai, Korean, Chinese Take-Out, and the first stationary Fukuburger it should be expected that F.A.M.E. is not yet firing on all cylinders - Beard Papa, boba, in-house pastry, and Fochun upstairs coming soon - but with full meals unlikely to top $15/pp and hours extending to 2am the concept is already poised to make waves as nearly everything I tasted was quite good. Beginning first with a few bites of chicken - a trio of karaage, 'bourban,' and orange - I was immediately impressed by the crunchy sapor of the first while the last was a touch too sweet and moving next through a basket of juicy shumai my attention turned to the 'truck,' my first Fukuburger moist and rich even before being gilded with a slightly overcooked egg and punchy accoutrements. Rarely impressed by potatoes but finding the crispy 'jazz' fries quite addicting as I chatted with the team about the upcoming "art, music, and entertainment" it was just prior to noon when my final plate arrived and with both duck and pork crispy yet supple beneath a touch of acid-sweet sauce I immediately swooned, a $12 plate worth the drive from Spring Mountain to The Strip as opposed to the other way around.</review:review_text>

See's is all about the free samples, see-gars, and chocolate lollipops for me. All of the samples I have had are really good, and I would consider giving the create your own box of chocolate card as a present, but they lack chocolate covered fruit. Tisk tisk.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>It's always a gamble  when you visit a restaurant on their opening night.  Luckily, there was no "walking away, knowing when to run" from me as Haveli delivered.  I'll be honest...this location has been haunted by former failed restaurants (Fitch's, Good Times, Kickshaw, Jimmy's) and their gigantic footprint.  In this case, the owners did the right thing and only used 1/3 of the former space.  Service was pleasant and efficient.  We ordered Samosas for our appetizer and Aloo Mutter and Goat Curry for our entrees.  While the filling of the Samosas was a little too heavy for my liking, the crust that encased it was great. Both entrees were very solid.  The flavors worked well with one another.  I was particularly impressed with the Goat Curry.  In the past at other places, the meat can be a little too "goaty".  Here is was well flavored and fall apart tender.
Haveli also has a lunch time buffet that I am eager to try.

Still early in it's existence but if it continues to dish out great food, I think it will be around to stay.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Jumpin Jehosaphat.  An even MORE authentic Texas roadhouse style saloon than 4 Mile Bar.  People dance here, on a dance floor with a spinning disco ball - the music's country, but it's tolerable country.  It was refreshing to see people actually dancing - I believe it's called line dancing, yes?  Sort of charming in a sickly sweet way.  Then there's about 12 pool tables for the "billiards" afficionados, and a real live actual fake bull for bull riding in its own padded pen.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>3.5 stars. New York style deli very much like Miracle Mile, except family owned and just done better. 

Ingredients and preparation match authentic NY delis for me. However, my friend who has had more experience going to such places in NY says its lacking. I think he's just suffering from a nostalgia complex, I don't know how you could make a Straw sandwich any better. Although, technically the family who runs it are New Hampshire/Massachusetts transplants. 

They also supposedly have the best hot dogs. I have seen them and they are extremely large and impressive looking. I don't eat hot dogs, but I'm guessing they are awesome since I have eaten their sauerkraut which is money.

Gets the bump to four stars for having some cool photographs of Phoenix architecture through the centuries.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>It is a cafeteria, I say this with all of the negative conotation that comes with that phrase.

Located in the beautiful Viad tower (former dial building) on the 2nd floor is this dimly lit cafeteria.

There are several stations including a sandwich station, grill, "world" and salad stations. At each station there is a small illegible at a distance sign of what is available.

Most food is made to order, which is problematic as I had to stand in line for over 10 min with a tray to get my meal, then there was another line to check out.

I ordered the salmon, which is not on the menu but the raw fish was on display. 

I ordered the fish and it was slapped on the griddle with a generous amount of clarified butter, there goes the healthy idea. Th fish was over cooked. As a side I selected a grilled vegetable salad that was ok but lacked flavor. The combo was about $6 with out a drink which seemed steep for a cafeteria.

The one nice thing is the fact there are several condiments at the exit, including buffalo sauce which was nice.  The sitting area is clean and nice.

Only eat here if you are stuck in this building and pressed for time.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>You'd be forgiven for walking straight past the entrance to this place, tucked down a flight of steps just off George Street, but in my opinion that's half of it's charm. It's popular and highly-regarded without needing to shout about it; people know about it because of the quality, not because it's in your face.

It's easy to see why. When you step inside it's like being on some sort of Japanese garden terrace, with the green leafy plants and water feature. Rick's pay great attention to detail: every table has a copy of that morning's newspaper neatly folded on it, next to the fresh flowers, and the service is efficient without being annoying and intrusive.

Although it's never going to make the Top 10 list of cheapest places in Edinburgh, you do get what you pay for. That said, at the moment all of the Montpeliers venues have their "Better By Half" promos on: glasses of house wine, selected cocktails, selected beers and even champagne by the glass are all half price at the moment. I've been making the most of these offers every time I'm out for fear that they might finish soon, but despite my panic-drinking it seems they're here to stay for a whie yet. Happy Days.

I've only ever drunk here, but one of these days I will be going for food... the plates I've seen being carried to other tables do look and smell gorgeous. There are always enough people in here to give the place a nice buzz, but never enough to make it the kind of busy where service starts to slump and the temperature goes through the roof.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Nothing wurst than a bad weenie. No bun intendend. But every so often I get a hankering for a hot dog. A Chicago hot dog at that. In the windy city at Milwaukee and Devon sits SuperDawg and it is a site to behold. But I ain't in the Windy City. I'm in the Hot Blistering Sweltering City. And I didn't know where to go. And then I drove down Thomas and saw the Vienna Beef sign! That was it. That's what I needed. The universe had answered my calling. You ever enter a restaurant and immediately have the instinct that you should turn your ass around and leave quickly. Yea. Well I didn't listent to my gut. Cuz it was rumbling with hunger and I could smell the hot dogs steaming. The place wasn't clean. Ok, it was dirty. Stained floors, rec room style paneling with splintering chunks of wood and vinyl chairs with duct tape. Hmmm...still not enough for me. So I get home with my Chicago style dog, with pepperoncini, neon relish, celery salt, tomatoes in a soft poppy seed bun with krinkle fries. Ate it in 90 seconds. Spent the next 40 minutes in my bathroom. You get the picture. Thank God for that Reader's Digest I found under the sink cuz I would have been real bored.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Very mediocre food. There is nothing special about their hotdogs and fries. Piece was definitely overpriced for quality. I think it's priced for location. I will only come back if I stayed at treasure island with no energy to talk anywhere outside their casino and all the other food spots were closed... Maybe then I'll get room service instead. Need to either change up the quality or the price. The place is quite slow, just 2-3 other tables were occupied.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>YUM! Great breakfast and service--in an airport?! SO SO good! French toast, sausage, eggs over medium; even their ice tea with fruit infusion is fantastic. Sat at counter: served politely and efficiently. Excellent experience! Matt's and Sky Harbor Airport are recognizing Phoenix and Arizona well. Makin' this home girl proud!!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>About once a week, the husband convinces me that we need pizza.  Ideally, we would get a real one made by people and not a chain.  But, this is often motivated by laziness and downtown Phoenix is the black hole of good pizza.  We would have to drive somewhere to get a good pie, and we're just not having that.

I have a confession to make.  Even though I'm from Buffalo, NY, a city with as many pizza joints as Phoenix has Circle K's, I like Pizza Hut.  It was always the excursion for us growing up.  Sure, we could get a $5 large delivered from the place down the street, but Pizza Hut was an evening out.  A restaurant for pizza, complete with the low-hung light fixtures and the red plastic glasses, it was a special occasion.  And although their pizza was nothing like normal pizza, I developed a special fondness in my tummy for the pan pizza.

And, I'm about to write a review for Domino's as a comparison to this debacle.

We ordered online + 1 star. The website said that it would take 90 minutes - 1 star.

They have blue cheese + 1 star.  The restaurant called to say that they no longer carry blue cheese - 1 star.

We ordered wings that were actually pretty spicy +1 star. They were breaded and had something sweet and sticky on it - 1 star.

The marinara sauce was watered down - 1 star

The delivery guy got lost, forgot the credit card slip and forgot the soda we ordered.  Then he had the nerve to ask me if we still wanted it.  Then he said it would take him an HOUR to return with the pop. -1 stars.

The order was delivered in less than the estimated 90 minutes (minus the pop), he did come back to deliver the 2 liter in less than 30 minutes, and the food was as mediocre as I expected it to be. + 2 stars

I would give a zero if I had to leave the house for this kind of service, but since dinner was delivered they earn 1 star.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Suruchi is a friendly, and serious Indian restaurant with some fun Scottish twists on their menu.

I came here on my first night in Edinburgh in search of vegetarian fare - two other veggie places right down the street didn't pan out for various reasons, and Indian food is always a safe bet. I had an excellent Kafta Makahi dish, and when ordered with the spice level "as you would have it, please - I like spicy foods" - I was not dissatisfied. It was perfectly spicy without being overwhelming, and the flavor was excellent all around. Service was quick and pleasant, and the cook checked to see how everything was.

Price paid for a main dish, drink (Irn-Bru), and garlic nann was 13,00£

If you're looking for great Indian food at a reasonable price, and/or a wide selection of vegetarian options (including veggie haggis fritters.. what!) then give Suruchi a shot.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Loved it years ago in LA....feel as though with any enormous chain restaurant, quality is suffering. Do I love that the menu is longer than the Bible? Or does it actually just drive me mad causing me to drive my salad fork into my forehead while perusing the ad-riddled pages? I'm always here for the comfort food. And I don't order those ridiculous salads, large enough to fill the salad bar at Soup Or Salad! Frankly I simply cannot digest all the raw roughage in one sitting. Cauliflower is no longer my friend. Yesterday I ordered the Hungarian Beef Ghoulash. Meet was very tender, gravy was too salty and the egg noodles that came with were a bit bland. I guess you need to ask for a gravy or sauce for them, cuz they was jest naked. Rickie's meatloaf, tasted just like my entree...I swear...I tasted no difference in the sauce. The Buffalo Chicken triangle thingy appetizer was different and tasty. Crispy, spicy triangles of lightly battered something or other filled with chicken. With so many newer places opening up all over town done in minimal/urban decor, The Cheesecake Factory really sticks out like a loud relative at a dinner party. Hmmm...will I go back? Probably...too convienent after movies at the Esplanade. And if I try everything on the menu eventually, I know I'll be navigating my walker with the yellow tennis balls attached, but I'm bound to find the fresh, consistent and comforting dish I so want.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The more I like places, the more I buy gifts there, but rarely anything for myself.  I really like Pottery Barn, especially the Pottery barn of about 8-10 years ago, and I've bought lots of things there, but I honestly can't remember buying anything for myself except some coasters that were on clearance.  Apparently I need to become much more selfish.

Pottery Barn is really awesome.  I've always thought there name could explain them.  Pottery - Nice, expensive, something to be valued at a higher level than just it's actual purpose.  Barn - Something casual, relatable, and very nostalgic.  I know that's not how they came up w/ the name, but it fits to me.  They want things that don't just function, but have a certain look that will be valued for it's look and longevity as much as it's purpose - while remaining very relatable and comfortable in the home. 

Their prices aren't as outrageous as you might think.  They aren't cheap, but they are fairly good for the quality.  But of course, if you are a good shopper (which is quite the past-time in the Greater Phoenix area), you can often find similar things for less.  Still, it's a great spot to find unique things for your home, wonderful gifts, and great ideas for where the trends are headed.  

Go check it out.  And buy a little something for yourself.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Very cheap and open later than most ethic restaurants on State Street (unless you count Qdoba as ethinc!)  Get a good meal with sizeable portions for $5-6.  Can be a little crowded....ok...a LOT...and the tables are a little small....but hey you can eat here for the same price as McDonalds, so who is complaining?</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>So driving down Elliott I saw this  place  and decided to stop.  We sat down, and the guy was so nice and attentive. We shared the chicken tikka masala. It was sooooo delicious! The service was incredible, and wasn't to pricey. The spices were perfect, not too spicy. I will definitely be back to try their buffet!</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>Not quite decided about this place. I went once with my mom, and had a great salad with apples, cranberries, and blue cheese. The soup was good too, some type of southwest chicken with rice and beans. They also have tasty cookies, and muffin tops(which is the best part, let's face it).

Recently when I went, I just ordered soup. I think it was supposed to be Chicken Enchilada or something. Disgusting. I was pissed that I paid almost five dollars for a bowl of thick, gloppy soup that tasted like someone just opened a bag of wholesale condensed nonsense. 

Good thing the iced tea was decent.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>= = = = = =  WEEKDAY LUNCH BUFFET!  = = = = = =

This mid-sized Peter Piper was JUMPING this morning &amp; they had an amazing 13 pizzas out when I arrived, plus bread sticks!  I did go ahead &amp; order up a custom, this time with Thin Crust, Pepperoni, Italian Sausage, Red Onion, bacon &amp; Jalepeño.  Then it was off to scoop up &amp; enjoy some of each of their 3 tossed salads.

Before long my pizza was up &amp; was it ever good!!  (Photo)

After wolfing down half of that one I couldn't resist grabbing slices of a couple different chef's choice pizzas which were really good too...  loaded up great with such things as triple cheese plus several other toppings.  YUM!     :-))

Weekday Lunch Buffet:  $5.99/$5.39 Sr.</review:review_text>

    <review:review_text>The Kings Balti should be a great 4 or 5 star restaurant.

The food is wonderful, especially the tandoori lamb, which is my favourate as it is cooked traditionally and always beautifully tasty. The restaurant itself is nice and modern, with an open plan kitchen and extensivly supplied bar. All of this is reasonably priced and of good quality.

However, and this is a big one, the service is terrible. Enough to put me off going back ever again I am afraid. Staff are rude, slow and incompetant. No help was offered to us at all for the first 25 mins of our visit, as though we had simply been forgotten about. When we were remembered, the waiter took our drinks orders, which today we are still waiting for as our first round never arrived. The service from that point remained shocking - and as a result, our meal was ruined.

Its such a shame as the food was great, even if i did have a bitter taste in my mouth.</review:review_text>
